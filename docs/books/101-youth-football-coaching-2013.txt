FOREWORD

Having worked with hundreds of players in my capacity as a coach,
choreographer and professional footballer, I totally understand the
power of football and the social benefits it provides. I believe that
101 Youth Football Coaching Sessions by Tony Charles and Stuart Rook has
adopted a unique approach to session planning and coaching. This is a
book like no other, one that features a broad range of coaching topics
which ensures children of all ages can participate in and enjoy
football, regardless of their level of ability, as every game is fun and
inclusive.

Furthermore, you can combine a number of warm-ups, games and exercises
to create an entire session tailored to your coaching requirements. This
can be achieved with ease by following the ‘session plans’ at the back
of the book or by simply selecting a combination of sessions yourself.

101 Youth Football Coaching Sessions has successfully brought together
the vast experience of community and advanced coaching in an easy to
follow and practical session book. This book is an essential resource
for any aspiring coach, teacher, youth worker or anyone with an interest
in developing grass roots football players.

INTRODUCTION

The main purpose of this book is to help coaches and players to get the
most out of their coaching sessions. By combining our three decades of
experience we have created 101 fun, informative and challenging coaching
sessions, designed to give players the maximum time with the football,
to enable them to improve their football skills. We believe that young
players learn best when they are enjoying themselves and have
accordingly designed this book around this principle by incorporating
fun, fast-paced warm ups, free-flowing imaginative technical sessions
and challenging small-sided game practices.

We have designed each session to be as inclusive as possible, with as
many players working with a ball, or a ball between two or three, as
often as it is viable, depending on the technique coached during the
exercise. This is in order to move away from old-fashioned line drills,
where the players are static and have to wait for their turn and might
only touch a football once every few minutes. Giving players more
touches of the ball will only help in their overall development. From
our experience, when working with children the more involved they are
and the more enjoyment the session brings, the less likely they are to
be disruptive or become disengaged from the session.

Each page in the book gives you a diagram showing how to set out the
session along with sub headings, which help you with the following
crucial areas of your session:

• Organisation – how to set out the correct sized area and how to
organise the players, which players need a ball or a bib and if there is
any particular requirement for the setting up of the session.

• Equipment – what specific equipment you will need to deliver the
session.

• Description – a description of the rules of the game and how it should
work successfully. This will point out the basic objective of the game
and how to find a winner of each game in order to make it competitive.

• Coaching points – the key coaching points of the session which you
need to try to get across to the players. For each game we have listed
three or four coaching points but feel free to include your own.

• Progressions – how to make the game more difficult. Some of the games
are very basic and can be progressed quite quickly, others are a little
bit more difficult to grasp and might take longer for the players to
master. One of the most important aspects of being a coach is knowing
when the group of players need to be progressed and their skills further
challenged.

• Instructions – this sub heading appears only in a small number of
sessions and relates to specific extra instructions that the coach will
need to call out during the course of the practice.

Learning how to plan a session is one of the most important skills a
coach can have. Understanding the level of ability, age range and level
of development of the players you coach will help you to know what you
can coach, what skills you need to coach and how you are going to coach
those skills, and is essential in the development of your players.
Remember, plan your work and work your plan!

The sessions

With the exception of the warm-ups, at the end of each session you will
find a series of numbers – these are session numbers and relate to other
games within the book. We have carefully selected games that we feel
work well with others to make up a complete football coaching session.
Warm-ups can be applied to any session and what we have suggested here
is simply a guide for you to work from and develop your own coaching
sessions, as we feel a coach should be adaptable and, above all,
imaginative.

The complete sessions we have suggested (indicated by the >>> symbol
usually consist of two or three fun football sessions and one or two
small-sided games. All of these sessions will correspond to the
technique being coached during the practice. For example: Session 22 –
‘Body ball’ is a dribbling game that we’ve matched with fun football
games 28 – ‘Shark attack’, 32 – ‘King of the ring’ and 68 – ‘Skillz
school’, which are all dribbling sessions, and small-sided game 78 –
‘Four corners’, where the idea of the game is to dribble the ball into
the corner in order to score a goal. This encourages the players to
apply the dribbling techniques that they have learned during the fun
games to their play in a conditioned small-sided game.

In each session we have also suggested where the coach should position
him or herself to be able to view and correct the technique of players
and to deliver the coaching points and progressions effectively, which
will help the players to get the most out of the session. It will also
ensure that the coach can survey the entire area and see everything that
is happening on a wider scale, particularly during the small-sided
games. Being able to see the ‘bigger picture’ is an essential coaching
skill and incorporating this into your sessions will help the players
develop into more complete footballers.

The position of the coach suggested in each session means the coach will
not be interfering with play, allowing it and therefore the session to
flow freely, while maintaining control from a broader viewpoint.

The timing for each session will depend on the age group and length of
your session. For example, an hour-long after-school club might consist
of a warm-up game (5–10 minutes), a fun football game (15–20 minutes),
then a conditioned small-sided practice (10–15 minutes), which would
then naturally develop into a practice match at the end.

For a 90-minute or two-hour session you might want to spend more time on
a specific technique or on two different techniques, incorporating three
or four different fun football games – or you may wish to spend more
time on the small-sided game conditioned practices. In this instance, a
longer warm-up would benefit the players by preparing them for a longer
session. The warm-up games can also be used as a cool down at the end of
the session.

Club coaches may well be able to identify an area that they feel needs
specific improvement in their team, and should design a session plan
with that goal in mind. Being able to spot certain strengths and
weaknesses in a team or a player and then planning how to improve on
those weaknesses or make best use of the strengths could mean the
difference between a good team and a great team.

We believe that to be a good coach you need to let your personality come
across in your sessions. Each page is a guide for you to use: feel free
to adapt any game to allow it to work best for you.

Finally, our biggest hope is that this book will inspire coaches,
teachers and parents to develop fresh, entertaining and informative
sessions and that they will always be positive, show encouragement and
provide examples of fair play. Keep up the good work and keep laying the
foundations for the football futures of young players.

Happy coaching!

WARMING UP

Warming up is one of the most important aspects of your coaching
session. It is vital that your players are warmed up properly in order
to maximise their performance and reduce the risk of injury. A warm-up
also helps the players to concentrate on the session ahead.

All these warm-up sessions can be used at the beginning of any coaching
session as they are inclusive and not restricted to one specific
football technique. Particular emphasis is given to the importance of
developing and mastering the basic physical skills of agility, balance,
coordination and speed, along with spatial awareness.

| session 1             |                       | traffic lights        |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Players move around inside the area listening to the
coach’s instructions. Each instruction gives a simple movement for
players to follow.

Examples of instructions: Green light = go (move around the area); red
light = stop (stand still); yellow light = get ready to go (jog on the
spot); reverse = move around the area backwards; speed bump = players
lie down on their back on the floor (if it’s not wet or muddy).

Coaching points: Encourage lots of movement. Spatial awareness – don’t
crash into another player. Listening skills.

Progressions: Coach makes up more commands (examples). Add a ball per
player, now each player dribbles a ball while trying to listen to and
perform each command.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 2             |                       | mirrors               |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set up two cones 5m apart. Players stand facing each
other, in between the two cones. Create sufficient areas for the number
of players.

Equipment: Marker cones, one football between two.

Description: One player leads (X), the other copies (Y). The lead has to
touch a cone to the left or right before the copier (mirror) gets there
by trying to outwit their opponent using a ‘fake’, dropping the shoulder
to move one way then actually moving the other way. Once a cone is
touched with the hand that player gets a point and the players switch
roles.

Coaching points: Keep low to make it easier to react to your partner’s
movement. Stay on your feet. Make your ‘fake’ believable, drop your
shoulder and try to change direction more than once.

Progression: Use a ‘double fake’ to lose your opponent, move both ways
to try to lose your defender. Introduce a football, now the ball must
touch the cone to win a point. Remember, mirrors can’t tackle their
opponent, but they can move side to side to block each cone.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 3             |                       | wake the giant        |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. The correct amount of cones are
randomly scattered around the area for the amount of players, so that
each (X) player can stand behind one cone each. One player (Y) stands in
the middle of the area.

Equipment: Marker cones, one bib, footballs.

Description: On the coach’s command the X players creep up to Y (‘the
giant’). Y has his eyes closed and stands so that he cannot see the X
players approaching. On the coach’s command, Y opens his eyes and tries
to ‘tag’ as many players as possible. If the X players make it to a cone
they are ‘safe’. Players that are tagged are now out and stand with the
coach. The aim for the X players is to sneak up to ‘the giant’ and tag
them on the back before they turn around.

Coaching points: Observation – watch the giant and his/her movements.
React quickly to escape from the giant. Once you have a ball keep it
close to your feet (during progression).

Progressions: Add an extra giant. Give each player a ball. Dribble the
ball using left or right foot only.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 4             |                       | derby day             |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 15 x 15m area. Players are on two teams (X/Y).
The coned lines on the left and the right, which mark out the area, are
named after two local rival teams, creating a derby atmosphere! The
players are separated into two teams and line up in the middle of the
area in single file – one behind the other, players alternate each time
(see diagram).

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: On the coach’s command the players run to the team line
called out and return. The first team to return is awarded a point. The
coach can try to confuse the players to make it difficult, for example
pointing to one line, but calling the command for the other line.

Coaching points: Listening skills. Observation. Encourage lots of
movement. Keep the ball close to your feet (during dribbling
progression).

Progressions: Introduce a football per player; the players now dribble
up to and away from the team line. Once at the team line perform a
‘fake’. Use a different turn each time.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 5             |                       | head catch            |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: In a 10 x 10m area, arrange the players in a circle with
the coach standing in the middle.

Equipment: Marker cones, one football.

Description: The coach takes turns moving around the circle to each
player and calls either ‘head’ or ‘catch’. The player does the opposite
action to that which is called, so for ‘head’ they catch the ball and
for ‘catch’ the player heads the ball back to the coach. If the player
gets the action wrong they are out – last player standing is the winner!

Coaching points: Listening skills. React as quickly as you can. Use your
forehead when heading the ball.

Progressions: If the player gets it wrong, they go onto one knee. The
coach throws the ball around the circle to players in a random order.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------------+
| session 6             |                       | heads, shoulders, knees and ball |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 10m area. Two players stand opposite each
other with a ball balanced on a cone in between them. Create sufficient
areas for the number of players.

Equipment: Marker cones, footballs.

Description: As the coach calls out a body part the player has to touch
that part of their body. For example, when the coach calls ‘head’ the
player touches their own head. When the coach calls ‘ball’ the first
player to grab the ball is the winner!

Coaching points: Listening skills. React as fast as possible to beat
your partner to the ball.

Progressions: Players start with their back to the ball so they have to
turn and grab the ball. Play in groups of three.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 7             |                       | protect the king      |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 10m area. Organise all of the players into
a circle, facing inwards with arms linked so they are huddled together
(X players). One player is named ‘the king’ and places a bib into the
waistband of their shorts, hanging down like a tail. Another player, (Y)
stands separate from the circle of (X) players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Working together, the X players have to protect their
‘king’ player from having the bib pulled out by the Y player by moving
clockwise and anticlockwise.

Coaching points: Move your circle around quickly. Communication is key.
Work as a team to protect your king.

Progressions: Add more X players to make a bigger circle. The Y player
dribbles a ball.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 8             |                       | excuse me please      |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. Scatter cones randomly around the
area. There should be fewer cones than players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones.

Description: Players move around the area. When the coach shouts
‘Cones!’ the players run and stand by the nearest cone. Any player who
doesn’t find a cone runs to another player and says ‘Excuse me please’.
This player then has to move and find a new cone and the second player
takes his place. Any player without a cone after a 10 second countdown
by the coach is out of the game or performs a fun forfeit.

Coaching points: Encourage movement. Spatial awareness. Use your speed
and acceleration to get to each cone quickly.

Progressions: Change movement to skipping, hopping and moving backwards
or sideways. Reduce countdown time to 5 seconds. Reduce the number of
cones, therefore increasing the number of players who go out or do a
forfeit.

| session 9             |                       | mr ice                |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones.

Description: Mr Ice (Y) holds a bib in their hand and runs around the
area trying to tag the other players (X). Once tagged the players freeze
and are out of the game. Ensure that each player is tagged with the bib
being held rolled up in a ball in the hand, and not being thrown at
other players.

Coaching points: Encourage lots of movement. Spatial awareness. Use body
swerves to lose Mr Ice.

Progressions: Add another Mr Ice, or Mrs Ice! Add a Mr Fire, who
unfreezes the frozen players, allowing them to rejoin the game.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 10            |                       | ball of life          |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, one football.

Description: Select two taggers (Y players), who each hold a bib. When
the coach says ‘go’ they have to try to tag an X player. If an X player
is tagged, they take the bib and become a ‘tagger’. However, all of the
X players have one ball between them and may pass the ball to each other
using their hands. Whenever an X player has the ball in their hands they
are safe, and cannot be tagged.

Coaching points: Encourage lots of movement. Spatial awareness.
Teamwork, share the ‘ball of life’ with your teammates to prevent them
from being tagged.

Progressions: Add another Y player. Limit the amount of time any player
can hold the ball of life to 5 seconds. X players pass the ball with
their feet.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 11            |                       | world cup warm-up     |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area and name each side of the area
after a famous World Cup-winning team.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The players move around inside the area. When the coach
calls the name of the country all the players run to that side as fast
as possible.

Coaching points: Encourage plenty of movement. Spatial awareness. Keep
the ball close to the feet (during dribbling progression).

Progressions: Change movements to forwards/backwards, side-to-side,
skips, over the gates. Last player to arrive at the line is out of the
game or does a fun forfeit. Give each player a ball, players dribble
around area and to each line.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 12            |                       | remote control        |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The players move around inside the area listening to the
coach’s instructions as he pretends to change channels on the TV. Each
instruction has a simple movement to follow.

Examples of instructions: Fast forward = Move around the area; Slow
motion = Players move in slow motion; Rewind = Players move backwards;
Formula One = Players pretend to drive around the area in a racing car;
Wimbledon = Players pretend to play a tennis match; Grand National =
players pretend to be part of a horse race.

Coaching points: Encourage lots of movement. Spatial awareness – don’t
crash into other players in the area and look for the big spaces.
Listening skills.

Progressions: Coach makes up more commands. Add a ball per player.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 13            |                       | foxes and farmers     |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. Select one player (Y) from the
group to be ‘the farmer’ while the rest are ‘foxes’. Each fox takes a
bib and places it into the waistband of their shorts, hanging down like
a tail.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones.

Description: When the coach shouts go, the farmer chases the foxes
around the area, trying to pull off their tails. If the tail is pulled
out, the fox is out of the game. The last remaining fox is the winner.

Coaching points: Look around so you don’t bump into anyone or run out of
the area. When the farmer chases you, turn around to face him so it is
more difficult for the farmer to pull the tail out.

Progressions: Start the game with two farmers. When a fox loses their
tail they become a farmer.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 14            |                       | cat and mouse         |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. Play 5 v 5 inside the area. Each
player from the ‘mice’ (Y) team takes a bib and places it into the
waistband of their shorts, hanging down like a tail.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones.

Description: The ‘cats’ (X) chase the mice (Y) around the area, trying
to pull out their tails. Once the tail is pulled out both the cat and
the mouse are out of the round until all mice are caught. Both teams
play as cats, with the coach timing both teams to see which is the
faster.

Coaching points: Work as a team to catch the mice. Use body swerves to
lose the cat. When the cat chases you, turn around to face him so it is
more difficult to pull the tail out.

Progressions: Give both teams a time limit of 30 seconds. Create an
overload for the mice. Play 4 mice v 6 cats making it more difficult for
the mice.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 15            |                       | around the world      |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 10m area. Set out a circle inside the area
with marker cones, size will depend on the number of players. One player
stands behind each cone, at least 5yd away from each other.

Equipment: Marker cones, footballs.

Description: The coach calls out a series of commands that relate to
movements, making them more and more difficult each time. For example,
one left = move to the cone to your left; one left, one centre, two
right = one to the left, in and out to the centre, then two right.

Coaching points: Be on your toes, ready to move. Use your listening and
reaction skills.

Progressions: Introduce more complicated combinations. Introduce
different movements – forwards, sideways, backwards etc. Each player
uses a ball and dribbles while completing each combination.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 16            |                       | cone raider           |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 20m area with five marker cones scattered
in the centre of the area. Players X and Y take a bib each and place it
into the waistband of their shorts, hanging down like a tail. Create
sufficient areas for the number of players. Add two defenders to protect
the cones in the centre of the area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones.

Description: Player X plays against player Y. On the coach’s command
they try to steal a cone from the centre of the area, one cone at a time
per player. The defenders try to defend the cones, by attempting to pull
out the tail of the X or Y player. If the tail is pulled out, the
attacking player (X and Y players) starts again. Play until all the
cones have been collected – whichever player has the most cones is the
winner.

Coaching points: Use body swerves to lose the defender. Check in and out
to make space for movement. The defender needs to stay low and side on.

Progressions: Play with two attackers (X and Y) against one defender
(D), with 10 cones scattered in central area. Play with two attackers
against two defenders, with 9 or 11 (odd number) cones scattered in
central area. Play with a time limit, with the winner being the player
who collects the most cones within the time limit.

| session 17            |                       | here, there and everywhere |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area, with one player in each corner
and seven cones in the middle of the square. Create sufficient areas for
the number of players.

Equipment: Marker cones, footballs.

Description: When the coach shouts ‘Go!’ the four players race to
collect the cones from the centre of the square and return them to their
corner – but they can only take one cone at a time. Once all the cones
have gone from the middle the players may steal cones from each other’s
corners. The first player to collect three cones is the winner. Players
cannot defend the cones in their corner, but must try to steal quicker
than their opponents.

Coaching points: Use your speed to collect the cones quickly. Play with
your head up so you can see who you need to steal from to prevent an
opponent winning the game.

Progressions: Use nine cones; first to collect four is the winner.
Replace the cones with footballs; players now dribble a football back to
their corner before turning to look for another ball – players may not
tackle one another while they are dribbling, only steal from the
corners. Play in pairs, taking alternate turns to collect a cone/ball.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 18            |                       | shopping list         |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. All players stand in a space in
the area.

Equipment: Marker cones.

Description: The players start moving around in the area. The coach
calls out his shopping list and any time he mentions a number the
players get into a group of that number of people as quickly as
possible, e.g. ‘I went to the shops and bought three apples’ means
players get into a group of three. Any player not in a group of the
right amount does a fun forfeit.

Coaching points: Move around the whole area. Players move in and out of
the spaces created by the movement, not in a circle. Be aware of other
players and spaces.

Progressions: Change movements to skipping, moving forwards or
backwards, or moving side-to-side. Coach tells stories of his shopping
list when he bought two apples and two bananas meaning players get into
a group of total items bought: e.g. a group of four.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 19            |                       | tag squares           |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 25 x 25m area, with two smaller 10 x 10m squares
at either end. Players are separated into two groups and are positioned
one group in each square.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: One player from the group in each square holds a bib and
tries to tag another player. If a player is tagged, they take the bib
and become the ‘tagger’. When the coach calls ‘Go’, the players race to
swap squares – with the last player to get to the other square becoming
the ‘tagger’.

Coaching points: Use body swerves to stay away from the tagger. Use
clever movement to avoid the tagger. Use your speed so you are not the
last player to the other square.

Progressions: Add an extra tagger. Change the type of movement between
squares—backwards, sideways, skipping. Give each player a ball, with the
tagger trying to win a ball from the other players instead of trying to
tag them.

| session 20            |                       | flip it, flop it      |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area and divide the players into two
groups. Give each group an equal number of cones and tell one group to
set out cones as ‘flop it’ (right way up, large base to the ground). Ask
the other group to set out cones as ‘flip it’ (wrong way up, small top
to ground).

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones.

Description: One group tries to turn the cones over one way – ‘flip it’,
the other the opposite way – ‘flop it’. Play for 90 seconds – whichever
team has flipped or flopped the most cones wins!

Coaching points: Encourage players to look around to see which cones
need to be flipped or flopped. Encourage positive and quick decision
making. Communication – ask the players waiting for their turn to point
out the cone that need to be flipped or flopped. Teamwork.

Progressions: Reduce the number of cones. Reduce the time limit to make
this a quick reaction activity. Extend the time limit to make this an
endurance activity.

FUN FOOTBALL GAMES

In this section you will find games that range from very easy and simple
techniques to more challenging practices for advanced players. These
sessions are designed to be simple to execute and fun in practice for
both coach and player.

The more basic games in this section serve as a great platform for
players who are starting out in football, while the more advanced
sessions are designed to put players to the test to help them to develop
as a player.

Regardless of the level of difficulty, the aim of each game is to engage
the player’s imagination and enthusiasm for football without focusing
too heavily on technique – in other words, guided discovery over mundane
line drills.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. Players are randomly spaced in
the area with one ball per player.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Players dribble around the area. The coach leads them in
the chorus of ‘Old MacDonald Had a Farm’. When the coach gets to ‘on the
farm he had some...’ he comes up with the name of a different animal
each time. The players have to do the animal impersonation – with
actions!

Examples of instructions: ‘Chickens’ = sit on the ball; ‘frogs’ = put
the ball between your knees and jump around; ‘pigs’ = push the ball
around the floor with your head; ‘rooster’ = move the ball around with
your elbows (like wings); ‘elephant’ = move the ball around with your
imaginary trunk (arm); ‘seal’ = try to balance the ball on your nose and
make a noise like a seal.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to your feet. Keep looking up and
around. Do the impressions yourself so that they are properly
demonstrated to the players.

Progressions: Dribble only using your weaker foot. Add a ‘wolf’ that
comes to the farm to steal the balls.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. Players spread out inside the
area, one ball per player.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Players dribble their ball around in the area. As the coach
calls out a body part, the players stop the ball with that part of the
body. For example, if the coach calls ‘knee’ the players have to stop
the ball with their knee, if the coach calls ‘elbow’ the players have to
stop the ball with their elbow, if the coach calls ‘head’ the players
have to stop the ball with their head. Try to come up with some more
difficult parts of the body to stop the ball with, such as ear, shin,
chest or nose.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to feet while dribbling. Look up
and around between touches. Use both feet. Use turns and changes of
direction.

Progressions: Make it into a competition: slowest player is out of the
game. Players use the specific body part to dribble the ball. For
example, if coach calls ‘knees’, players have to dribble the ball with
their knees for 30 seconds. Introduce a ‘passive’ defender to add
pressure – a passive defender adds pressure by closing the ball down and
restricting space, but not actually tackling the players or stealing the
ball.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. Set players out in pairs with one
ball per pair.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Player X starts with the ball. Player Y (their partner)
runs around the area trying to stay as far away as possible from player
X, who chases after them while dribbling the ball. When the coach shouts
‘Freeze!’ all players stop and stand still. Player Y then turns to face
their partner, and player X attempts to pass the ball through their
legs. Players then switch roles.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to the feet when dribbling. Look up
and around between touches. Try to use the correct weight and accuracy
each time you pass, using the inside of the foot.

Progressions: Use the weaker foot when dribbling. Use the weaker foot
when passing the ball. Award points for each successful pass.

| session 24            |                       | colour squares        |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Inside a 25 x 25m area, mark out four different coloured
smaller areas using marker cones. The X players have one ball each and
dribble around the area, while a Y player is outside the area but cannot
see the area (closes eyes).

Equipment: Marker cones, footballs.

Description: Coach gives the players inside the area a five-second
countdown. During this countdown the players dribble around the area
finding a square to stop in. The coach asks the Y player to call out a
colour, and anyone inside that coloured square is out of the game.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to the feet. Look up and around in
between touches. Encourage positive and quick decision making.

Progressions: Change movements to each square (dribble, juggle the ball,
left/right foot only). Limit players to a three-second countdown.

>>> 26 – 37 – 66 – 78

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. Place small cones randomly around
the area. Each player plays inside the area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Players dribble around small cones that are scattered
around the area. The object of the game is to pick up as many of the
cones as possible while keeping the ball under control.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to your feet. Take small touches.
Keep your head up. Encourage spatial awareness (other players, other
footballs and space within the area). Changing direction and turning
with the ball.

Progressions: Restrict use of different feet (right foot only, left foot
only). Alternate feet (use left foot, then right foot). Players have to
balance cones on their heads as they collect them. Add a passive or
active defender to pressure the ball – a passive defender adds pressure
by closing the ball down and restricting space, but not actually
tackling the players or stealing the ball, whereas an active defender is
allowed to tackle and try to steal the ball.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area with four 5 x 5m squares in each
corner. Players are separated into teams of three and placed in each
corner square. Each corner square is named after a famous football
stadium.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Players move around in the corner squares, dribbling their
footballs. As the coach shouts ‘Stadium swap!’ the players have to run
to the next stadium. Players move in a clockwise direction.

Coaching points: Players must move around their ‘stadium’ without
bumping into each other. Keep the ball close to the feet while
dribbling. Push the ball a little bit further out from the feet when
travelling from one stadium to the next.

Progressions: Players dribble using weaker foot only. Use two balls
between three players and have players passing the ball in the stadiums,
running with the ball when they swap.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. One ball per player, except for
one player who starts without a ball.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: All players, except one, have a ball each and dribble
around the area listening for the coach’s commands. When the coach calls
‘Change’ all players leave their ball where it is and try to find a new
ball. The player without a ball also tries to find a ball, leaving a
different player as the ‘odd man out’. This player then jogs around, and
waits for the next ‘Change’ call from the coach to grab someone’s ball.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to the feet. Look up and around
between touches. Use inside and outside of the foot, using both feet.
Move to a new ball as fast as you can.

Progressions: Add the command of ‘tap’ where the player stops their
ball, taps their foot on the top of another ball and then returns to
their own ball. Have two players without a ball. Add turns (i.e. inside
or outside hook) and moves to beat a player (i.e. step over or a shimmy)
on different commands.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. Y players act as defenders
(‘sharks’) and are joined together, either holding a bib between them or
by linking arms. X players have a ball each.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: X players dribble their ball around the area avoiding the Y
pairs (sharks). If one of the Y pairs steals their ball they are out of
the game and stand by the coach.

Coaching points: Look up and around between touches to see where Y
players are. Keep the ball close to the feet and under control. Use
turns and changes of direction.

Progressions: If an X player gets caught by a shark they leave their
ball to the side of the area and join as an extra defender, helping the
sharks to catch the remaining X players. Give sharks a ball between two,
so they now have a ball to dribble while they move around, taking it in
turns to dribble and direct.

| session 29            |                       | crocodile sandwich    |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 30m area. Two players are stationed in the
middle of the area (Y) with the rest of the players (X) standing on the
end line with a ball each.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The two players (Y) are the crocodiles. The X players
dribble their ball past the defenders to the other end line. Once they
reach the end line they are safe and wait for the coach’s command to try
to get back to the other end line. If a crocodile manages to steal a
ball, that player becomes a crocodile. The last X player left with a
ball is the winner.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to the feet while dribbling. Look
up and around between touches while dribbling. Change direction to keep
the ball away from defenders. Accelerate into spaces away from the
defenders.

Progressions: Add extra defenders (crocodiles) after each round. Join
the two defenders by holding a bib between them so they are connected
and have to work as a team to steal the footballs.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. One player (Y) starts with a
ball, the remaining players, without a ball, spread out inside the area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The Y player dribbles the ball around the area and attempts
to hit the X players by passing the ball, aiming below the knee. Once an
X player is hit, they get a ball and join the Y player.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to your feet while dribbling.
Dribble with your head up. Make accurate passes using the inside of the
foot.

Progressions: Start the game with two Y players. Pass only with the
weaker foot. Have one ball between two Y players so they pass to each
other trying to strike out the X players.

>>> 27 – 39 – 44 – 85

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. Select one player (Y) to be the
dogcatcher. This player does not have a football. Everyone else (X) has
one football and stands inside the area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: On the coach’s command the dogcatcher (Y) tries to kick
everybody’s football out of the grid. Whoever ends up as the last player
remaining wins.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to your feet. Use the inside of
your foot. Be aware of footballs and players around you.

Progressions: Start the game with two dogcatchers. Players may only use
their weaker foot. Players work in pairs, with one ball between two,
trying to keep their ball away from the dogcatchers.

>>> 25 – 38 – 63 – 83

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. One ball per player. All players
need to stay inside the area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: All players (X) dribble around the area trying to avoid
other players. If another player loses control of their ball or gets too
close they can make a tackle and kick the ball out of the area. If a
player’s ball leaves the area they are out of the game.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to the feet while dribbling. Look
up and around between touches. Use turns, skills and changes of
direction to move away from the defender (in progression).

Progressions: Start the game with one defender, who doesn’t have a ball.
Once their ball is kicked out of the area that player becomes a
defender.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. Set up small gates or goals using
marker cones around the area, made up of two cones 3–5m wide. Players
work in pairs, one ball for each pair.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The players work in pairs, dribbling to each gate or
‘goal’. As they arrive at a goal they must make five good passes
(correct weight, inside of foot, not touching the gates on the way
through) before moving to another goal. Only one pair can work at a goal
at any time.

Coaching points: Pass the ball with the inside of the foot. Correct
weight of pass – not so hard so it’s too difficult for your partner to
control, but not too soft so that the pass reaches your partner. Keep
the ball close to your feet when dribbling to the next gate. Keep your
head up so that you are aware of other players and empty gates.
Communicate with your partner.

Progressions: Introduce a time limit. How many gates can you visit in 60
seconds? Have one pair of defenders in the area without a ball.
Defenders try to steal the ball from the other players in the area. Make
the gates smaller.

>>> 26 – 77 – 78 – 80

| session 34            |                       | capture the flag      |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 40 x 30m area. Divide the area into two halves
with a centre line of cones. Mark 5 x 5m squares in each corner, one
square in each half is the jail and the other is the bank. Place five
balls in each bank.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The idea of the game is for one team to collect all the
footballs by invading the other team’s half of the area, taking a
football from their bank and dribbling it back to their own bank.
Players are safe in their own half but if a player is tagged while in
the opponent’s half they must go directly to the opponent’s jail. A
player is released from jail only when a teammate crosses into the
opposing half and high fives them. The first team to collect all of the
balls wins.

Coaching points: Try to use both feet to dribble the ball. Keep your
head up to look for space within the area. Work as a team. Communicate
as a team.

Progressions: Allow teams to pass the ball to each other when stealing
from the other team. Limit the number of players allowed in the
opposition’s half.

[]

Organisation: Set out a triangle with each point 10m apart. Position two
players on the outside of the triangle, with a ball each. Create
sufficient areas for the number of players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: While dribbling the ball player X tries to tag player Y by
chasing him around the outside of the triangle. Player Y can dribble in
either direction in order to lose his marker.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to your feet to ensure it is under
control. Dribble with your head up so you can see which direction your
opponent is coming from. Use as many different types of turn as you can
to change direction.

Progressions: Limit players to a specific type of turn, i.e. only an
outside hook turn or only a drag back. Allow players to turn using only
their weaker foot. The chasing player does not use a ball, making it
harder for the dribbling player.

>>> 23 – 66 – 69 – 98

| session 36            |                       | picnic basket         |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 30m area. One player (Y) stands at one end
of the area with his back to the rest of the players (X), without a
ball. Place five cones (or more depending on size of group) behind Y.
Each X player has a ball and a bib tucked into the waistband of the
shorts like a tail.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: When Y has his back turned, the other players (X) start to
dribble towards the opposite line, in order to try to steal a cone from
behind the Y player. When Y turns around all the X players have to
freeze – anyone caught moving gets sent back to the start line. Once a
cone has been stolen, Y chases the X players back to the start line and
tries to catch them by pulling out their tail. X players need to turn
quickly with their ball and dribble past the end line to be safe.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to the feet when dribbling. Turn
quickly. Accelerate after turning. Push the ball a little further out
from your feet when running with the ball.

Progressions: Gradually add more defenders (Y players). Allow Y players
to tackle after a cone is stolen, instead of pulling out the tails.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 25 x 25m area, with a 5 x 5m square in the
centre. On each touchline mark out four more 5 x 5m areas and place 16
footballs in the centre square. Put the players into four teams in each
of the touchline squares.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Like a relay race, when the coach shouts ‘Go’ the first
member of each group runs out of their square and takes a ball and
dribbles the ball back, then a teammate can go. The team with the most
balls wins.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to the feet when dribbling. Turn
quickly. Accelerate after turning. Push the ball a little further out
from your feet when running with the ball.

Progressions: Once all the balls are collected from the centre allow
players to steal a ball from someone else’s square – players must go
through the middle square on the way there and the way back. Allow
players to go two at a time.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 30m area. Players work in pairs, one ball
per pair, and are stationed randomly within the area. Set up six small
gates, two cones 2m apart around the outside of the area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: X starts with the ball. The object of the game is to
dribble through as many gates as possible in 2 minutes. The defender (Y)
must attempt to dispossess the player in possession. If a player
dribbles through a gate and stops the ball, score 3 points. Every turn
or fake demonstrated scores 1 point. First player to 10 points wins.
Once a goal is scored, the defender gets the ball. Players cannot go to
the same goal twice in succession.

Coaching points: When the defender (Y) gets alongside (X), they should
try to turn and go in a different direction. Make space, then accelerate
away. Shield the ball and move into space away from the defender. Keep
your head up and look around, so that you are aware of where the gates
are.

Progressions: Develop into two teams with one ball. Two teams, but two
balls in play.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 30m diameter circle area with a central cone.
Pairs (X and Y) stand 15m from the cone. Each pair has a ball. Create
sufficient area for the number of players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: X approaches the cone, does a turn then passes to Y. Y is
told to ‘hold the ball’. X then runs around behind Y, receives the ball
back out in front and goes to the cone, completes another turn, and then
dribbles back to Y. Repeat with Y now dribbling.

Coaching points: Dribble to the cone in the middle and turn quickly.
Accelerate after the turn. Try to disguise the turn. After turning, get
the ball out from under your feet.

Progressions: Instead of ‘holding the ball’, X dribbles to Y and plays a
1–2 pass. X then lets the ball roll through his legs, turns and dribbles
to the central cone to do another turn. X dribbles the ball back to Y,
plays a 1–2 pass but receives the ball after running around Y. Y has
only one touch.

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 10m area, placing a cone at each corner of
the square. Position two players at opposite corners of the area. Create
sufficient area for the number of players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Players X1 and Y1 dribble to the cone, do a turn, sprint to
the next cone, turn again and make a pass their partner.

Coaching points: Speed away from the cone – slow down towards the cone.
Get low – have a wide stance. Get the ball out of your feet. Use a
variety of turns: outside hook, inside hook, Cruyff turn, stop turn,
step-over turn.

Progressions: Make it a race between X and Y player, where the quickest
wins a point. Follow the pass to force X2 to get the ball out of their
feet. Work both directions in order to practise with both feet.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 20m area. Position one player at each of
the end lines of the area, and one player in the centre. Create
sufficient areas for the number of players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The player in the centre stands with their legs open as
wide as possible while the players at each end take it in turns to
attempt to pass the ball through. A point is scored each time the ball
is passed through Y’s legs cleanly. First player to 5 points wins, then
rotate players.

Coaching points: Pass using the inside of your foot. Correct accuracy
and weight of pass – depending on the distance of your partner. Correct
placement of your standing foot.

Progressions: Players can only pass using their weaker foot. Reduce the
size of the passing gap. Increase the distance of the pass.

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 20m area. The players work in pairs on
opposite sides of the area. In the middle of the area, in between each
pair, place a marker cone with a ball balanced on top. Give a ball to
each pair. Create sufficient areas for the number of players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The players pass the ball across the area with the aim of
knocking the ball off their cone in the centre. Each player takes
alternate turns with their partner with one point being scored for each
time they knock the ball off the cone.

Coaching points: Pass the ball with the inside of your foot. Correct
placement of your standing foot. Practice passing with both feet.
Correct weight of pass.

Progressions: Each time the player knocks the ball off the cone, they
take a big step backwards to increase the distance of the pass. Make the
pass using the outside of the foot. Players work in pairs and combine
their scores – first team to 10 wins.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 20m area. One player starts at each end of
the grid, one ball per pair. Create sufficient areas for the number of
players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The object of the game is for each player to pass the ball
past his or her opponent’s baseline in order to score a point. The
player at the opposite end tries to prevent the point being scored by
stopping the ball before it crosses the line, but they may only use
their feet. The ball must travel below waist height.

Coaching points: Pass using the inside of your foot. Control the ball
with the inside of the foot, trying to ‘kill’ it so it doesn’t bounce
back to the other player.

Progressions: If player returns the pass and scores with their first
touch they score two goals. Play using alternate feet to control and
pass.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area, with different coloured cones
lined across the centre. Split players into two teams who stand behind
the baseline of each side of the area, facing the cones, with three or
four balls per team.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Players pass the balls trying to knock down the cones in
the centre. X players aim for red cones, Y players aim for yellow cones.
Players must stay behind the baseline when passing the balls but may
move forward to collect another ball.

Coaching points: Make your pass as accurate as possible to knock down
the cone. Pass the ball using the inside of your foot. Pass the ball
along the baseline to get a better angle at a cone, encouraging
teamwork.

Progressions: Pass the ball only using the weaker foot. Use different
parts of the foot to strike the ball – inside, outside, laces. Increase
the distance of the passes by moving the baseline further away from the
cones.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 20m area. Repeat in other areas for correct
amount of players. Station two players at one end with a ball behind a
marker cone. At the other end of the area balance three balls on three
cones and have another cone spare. Create sufficient areas for the
number of players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Players work in pairs, taking it in turns to pass the ball,
trying to knock the ball off the cone at the other end of the area. The
player then retrieves the ball for their partner’s turn. First pair to
knock down their three balls wins the gold medal.

Coaching points: Use the inside of the foot when passing. Make your pass
as accurate as possible to knock the ball off the cone. Use the correct
weight of pass for the distance required. Correct placement of standing
or non-kicking foot.

Progression: Once a ball has been knocked off a cone, the player may
take the ball and place it on the spare cone of a different team. First
team to have four empty cones is the winner!

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 30m area. Players work in pairs. Station
two players (Y) with a ball each at the baseline; the remaining pairs of
players face each other on the sidelines, opposite their partner. Place
cones randomly across the middle of the area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The Y players must dribble across the area without being
hit on or below the knee by footballs which are being passed back and
forth by the X players. Y players must attempt to pick up cones as they
dribble across the area. Count the number of cones picked up in a
30-second period then rotate pairs so that everyone gets a turn to
dribble and collect the cones.

Coaching points: Use the inside of the foot to pass the ball. Try to
strike through the mid-line of the ball in order to keep the ball on the
ground. Be aware of footballs and players around you.

Progressions: Pass the ball only using the weaker foot. Reduce the time
limit to 20 seconds.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 30m square, with a smaller 10 x 10m square
in each corner. Each square has four players; each player is numbered
one to four in each of their squares with one ball per square.

Equipment: Marker cones, footballs.

Description: The players pass the ball around within their square. On
the coach’s command the numbered players move clockwise to the next
square, one at a time. For example, if the coach calls ‘Number 1’, all
the number 1s move into the next square.

Coaching points: Encourage the players to communicate and call for the
ball. Encourage players to move around as much as possible, no standing
still. Use the correct passing technique.

Progressions: Limit players to two touches each time they receive the
ball. The player entering the square must receive the ball straight
away. Put a cone in the middle of the area; the players run to the cone
then return to their original square.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area. Players work in two teams, one
team on each side of the area; a player from each team is stationed at
the midway point at the side of the square. Five footballs are set up on
the other side of the square opposite the players, also at the midway
point. Place a number of cones across the middle of the area, staggered
distances apart, to create a slalom.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The two players to the side of the square run across the
area, through the slalom of cones and collect a ball from the other
side. They then have to dribble the ball back through the slalom to the
start point. Meanwhile, the other team players are passing the balls
across the square trying to hit the opposing players running across. The
Xs are trying to hit the Y, and vice versa, to help their team. Players
can only aim for below the knee. If they are hit they have to go back to
the start point. The first player to collect three of the five balls is
the winner.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to your feet while dribbling. Try
to make accurate passes using the inside of the foot. Look up and around
to avoid other footballs.

Progressions: Dribble using one foot only. Pass with the weaker foot
only. Player has to do kick ups on the way back through the slalom,
keeping the ball off the floor.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 30m area. Place the cones in two rows, 5m
apart and 10m long. Split the group into two teams (X and Y). X players
are placed opposite each other, in between the two rows of cones and are
given one ball between two while the Y players line up at the end of the
area. Finally, place six cones at the other end to represent ‘treasure’.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: X players pass the ball to their partner. On the coach’s
command, Y runs through the middle of the area and tries to return with
one cone while trying to avoid getting hit on the knee or below. Once
all Y players have been, X players try to beat their score.

Coaching points: Use the inside of the foot to pass the ball. Be aware
of footballs and players around you. Correct placement of standing foot.

Progressions: Pass only using the weaker foot. The team collecting the
cones can go two at a time, working in pairs.

[]

Organisation: Set out five cones in a cross formation 12m apart. Players
work in pairs, the second player in each pair (Y) has a ball. Create
sufficient areas for the number of players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: On the coach’s command, the X players race to the centre
cone and then out to play a wall pass with each Y player, returning to
the centre cone between each pass. The first player to get back to their
start point having played four passes is the winner. Rotate players and
keep scores.

Coaching points: Try to use the correct weight for the pass. Concentrate
on the accuracy of passes. Call early for the ball. Use correct
technique for first touch.

Progressions: Player Y starts with the ball in hands and serves underarm
for a controlled volley return pass. Player Y starts with the ball in
hands and serves underarm for chest or thigh control and a return pass.
Player X starts with the ball, dribbles to the centre cone and turns
each time, then plays a wall pass to player Y.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 30m area with a centre line dividing the
area into two halves. Arrange teams into 5 v 5.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football.

Description: The attacking team (Y) spreads out, and plays 5 v 1 against
the defender (X). After five successful passes the attackers score a
point and another defender joins in. Continue until all the defenders
are in play. If the ball is intercepted before five passes the teams
swap roles. Whichever team scores the most points after five turns each
is the winner.

Coaching points: Pass with the inside of the foot. Create an angle for
the pass. Encourage positive and quick decision making. Communication:
ask players to call for the ball. Teamwork.

Progressions: Make the area bigger (for defenders). Limit players to two
or three touches (for attackers).

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 25 x 25m area, with a 10 x 10m square area
inside. Place a football at each corner of the inner square and balance
one on top of a cone in the centre. Position players in pairs or in
small teams in the corners of the larger square.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: When the coach shouts ‘Go!’, the first player from each
team races to complete a full circuit of the ‘running track’ – the area
inside the large square, but outside the smaller one. When the player
returns to the ball on their corner of the smaller square they pass it
towards the centre aiming to knock the ball off the central cone. The
first player to knock the ball off gets one point for their team. Rotate
players and keep score.

Coaching points: Use the inside of the foot to pass the ball. Use the
correct weight and accuracy for the pass. Keep the ball close to the
feet when dribbling (during progression).

Progression: Players may only use their weaker foot to pass the ball.
Players collect the ball and dribble around the running track then pass
when back to their starting point. The coach calls ‘Turn’ as the players
are dribbling around the running track and the player has to change
direction.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 20m area. Two shooters are stationed one at
each end of the area with a goal and a goalkeeper in the middle – the
size of the goal should depend on the age and the level of ability of
the players. Create sufficient areas for the number of players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The goalkeeper rolls the ball to one of the players at the
end of the area who takes a touch to control then shoots at the goal in
the centre. The player at the other end then takes a turn to shoot.
Shooting players play head to head, first to 10 goals wins, and then
rotate the goalkeeper.

Coaching points: Shoot using your laces. Try to hit the target (the
goal). Aim for corners of the goal. Keep the ball low to make it
difficult for the goalkeeper to make a save.

Progression: Allow shooters a one-touch rebound. Shooters must shoot
first time from the goalkeeper’s roll out. Award points for goalkeepers
per save. Each time the shooter scores a goal they take one big step
back, so they are further away from the goal.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 40 x 20m area with four goals positioned along
the centre of the area, two facing each way. Select four players to be
the goalkeepers and divide the rest of players into four groups, with
each player being a striker (X).

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs, goals.

Description: On the coach’s command X tries to score against the
goalkeeper in front of them. After striking, the player takes the
football and goes into the next position to take on the next goalkeeper.
Everybody continues to shoot if the path in front of them is clear.

Coaching points: Shoot as quickly as possible. Shoot low and aim for the
corners. Shoot hard using the laces. Observe the goalkeeper to see if he
moves too early.

Progressions: Shoot with first touch. Use a shooting line (must shoot
before you meet the line). Introduce a slalom before shooting. How many
goals in a time limit.

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 10m area. Players work in groups of three
with three balls per group. Create sufficient areas for the number of
players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: X passes the ball to Y who turns and tries to shoot past Z.
Player Y is allowed only three touches to score. See how many times a
player scores out of three balls.

Coaching points: Try to hit the target. The receiver’s first touch
should be slightly angled to the side. Try to turn and shoot in one
movement.

Progressions: The shooting player can only use the weaker foot. X now
serves the ball with a throw in. Add a defender so the attacker has to
turn, beat the defender then try to score.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 20m area. Organise players into two teams,
with two players as goalkeepers and the remainder from each team lined
up in pairs behind the goal at each end. Mark out a line of cones 5yd in
front of each goal across the width of the area; creating two
goalkeeper’s areas and a middle area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs, goals.

Description: One player takes a shot, trying to score in the opposite
goal. If they score they get one point but if the shot misses the target
(i.e. goes wide or over) both players swap places with their teammates
behind the goal. If the shot is saved by the opposition goalkeepers,
play continues, with a player from that team taking a shot at goal. When
a goal is scored, the two goalkeepers that concede the goal must change
places with their teammates behind the goal. All shots must be taken
from inside the goalkeeper’s area; first team to 10 points wins the
game.

Coaching points: Strike the ball with the laces. Throw the ball overarm
(when progressed). Hit the target. Aim for the corners of the goal.

Progressions: Players may throw the ball overarm, or roll it underarm
using goalkeeping techniques. Allow players to kick the ball from hands.
Introduce the middle area as ‘no man’s land’. If the ball is in no man’s
land a player from either team may run in and take a first time shot.

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 30m area. Select one player to be the
goalkeeper (GK). Divide the rest of players into three groups; strikers
(X), servers (Y) or ball boys (BB).

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs, goal.

Description: Each server (Y) has a number and as the coach calls a
number, that player serves the ball into X who takes a touch and tries
to score. Each X player takes a turn then all three teams rotate
positions.

Coaching points: Shoot as quickly as you can. Shoot low and aim for the
corners of the goal. Shoot hard.

Progressions: Shoot with the first touch. Add a defender to apply
pressure to the shooter.

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 20m area. Add a goal and goalkeeper at one
end. Organise two players (X and Y), who play head to head, and two
servers (S1 and S2) to the side of the grid. Create sufficient areas for
the number of players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Player X starts with a football and passes it to a server,
either S1 or S2. The server then sets the ball back for player X who
shoots at goal first time. Players X and Y take turns; first to five
goals is the winner, then swap places with the servers.

Coaching points: Shoot using your laces for power. Shoot using your
instep for placement. Aim for the corners of the goal. Keep your head
over the ball.

Progressions: Shoot using weaker foot only. After the server sets the
ball, the server on the opposite side moves to try to block the shot –
applying pressure to the shooting player. Allow player Y to follow up
any rebounds, making it a race to score the rebound.

Organisation: Set out a 25 x 25m area, with three teams facing a goal,
where each player has a ball. Create sufficient areas for the number of
players. Mark out a line across the area as a shooting line. The
distance of this line from the goal should depend on the age and level
of ability of the group.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs, goal.

Description: Player X dribbles their football to the shooting line and
takes a shot at the goal, then turns to face player Y. Player Y plays a
wall pass with player X, takes a shot at the goal, then turns to face
player Z. Player Z dribbles their football and plays 1 v 1 against
player Y, attempting to score a goal (player Z may score from past the
line). Rotate player starting positions.

Coaching points: Shoot using your laces. Aim for the corners of the
goal. Correct weight and accuracy of passes. Use skills, tricks and
feints to beat the defender.

Progressions: Player X does a trick or a move to beat a player before
shooting at the goal. Allow both Z players to play against player Y,
creating an overload. Make the shooting line further away from the goal
to encourage shots from distance.

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 30m area with four goals placed along each
touchline. Players are lined up at each corner and each player is given
a number, i.e. 1–4, or 1–5 depending on number of players in each team.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs, goals.

Description: When the coach calls out a number (e.g. ‘Number 1’) and
serves the ball into the area. The players from each team with that
number (e.g. of the four players, the one from each team who is
numbered 1) enter the area and play against one another. The first
player to score in any of the goals wins one point for their team.

Coaching points: Strike the ball with the laces. Be aware of players and
the nearest goal to you. If a goal is blocked, use a turn to change
direction and attack a different goal.

Progressions: Call out more than one number at a time. Reduce the number
of goals on the pitch. Add a goalkeeper to each goal.

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 10m area. Players work in pairs with one
ball per pair, one player positioned on each end line so that the
players are opposite each other. Two cones are placed midway between the
two players but 5yd wider to either side.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football.

Description: X starts with the ball and passes it to Y. As soon as Y
touches the ball, X leaves the cone they are standing at, and towards Y
to try to win it back. Y tries to dribble to either of the two midway
(wide) cones to score one point. If Y dribbles the ball around X to the
cone at the other end (which X has just vacated), they score two points.
Repeat the practice with X in possession.

Coaching points: Push the ball to the side and accelerate into space
behind the defender. Change speed and direction. Use fakes and turns.

Progression: If the defender wins the ball, he becomes the attacker and
tries to score.

Description: X1 starts with the ball and tries to beat defender Y1 by
crossing the halfway line at the 10m marker. Once in the other half, X1
can pass to their teammate who is standing in the centre of the end
line. If the defender (Y1) wins the ball, they can immediately attack
the opposing half.

Coaching points: Attack the space to the sides of the defenders. Use
your change of pace and change of direction to out-play your opponent.
Once you make space, try to play the ball forward.

Progressions: Allow the end line players to move along the line to
receive the ball. Allow attacking players to pass the ball from inside
their own half.

stands at a midway point to the side of the goal, and the third player
is the attacker (Y) and stands at the baseline. Create sufficient areas
for the number of players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goal.

Description: The goalkeeper starts with the ball and passes to Y who
must attempt to dribble past X and score a goal. If the defender wins
the ball, they should try to dribble over the end line. Play for five
attacks then rotate positions.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to your feet. Beat your opponent
with a ‘believable’ trick. Make an early decision.

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 30m area and place two rows of cones 5m
apart along a 10m length in the middle of the area, in front of a goal.
Split the group into two teams (X and Y). The X players are placed in
between the two rows of cones; they cannot move forwards or backwards,
only sideways. A goalkeeper is in goal at the end of the grid. Y players
are lined up with a ball each.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goal.

Description: On the coach’s command, Y tries to dribble past each
defender (X) by using a trick. If Y manages to dribble past every
defender they can try to score a goal. X players try to defend the goal
by kicking the ball out of the area.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to your feet. Make your move to
beat a player (i.e. step over, feint) believable.

Progressions: Introduce more defenders. Reduce the defenders’ space.

triangle at each end of the area, each side approximately 3m long.
Create sufficient areas for the number of players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Play 1 v 1. Players can score two ways: first, they can
dribble into the triangle and stop the ball with the sole for two
points. Secondly, they can pass the ball through the triangle for one
point. First player to reach five points wins.

Coaching points: Encourage the players to use feints, step-overs and
other moves to beat an opponent. Use the inside of the foot to make an
accurate pass through the triangle. Move the ball quickly to create
enough space to make the pass through the triangle.

Progressions: Add a player to each side to make the game 2 v 2. The ball
has to be passed into the area with the teammate controlling the ball to
score a point. Encourage movement off the ball.

Organisation: Set out a 25 x 25m area, with two goals inside the area
facing away from each other. Two teams line up to the side of the area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: As the coach rolls the ball into the area, one player from
each team enters and they play 1 v 1. The first player to score in
either goal is the winner, if the ball goes out of play, that game is
over. Rotate players and keep score.

Coaching points: Shield the ball using your body to keep the ball. Use
your dribbling skills to beat your opponent. If you can’t score in one
goal, use a turn to change direction and attack the other goal.

Progressions: Move the position of the goals. Play 2 v 2. Introduce a
time limit to each game.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 10 x 20m area. Play 2 v 2 with four small
‘goals’ placed in the corners of the area. Position the teams one at
each end of the area, this will be the end line, which they defend.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Teams play 2 v 2 and score points by stopping the ball on
the opponent’s end line for 1 point, dribbling through one of the small
goals for 3 points or by using a move to beat a player then dribbling
through a small goal for 5 points.

Coaching points: Encourage attacking play in 1 v 1 situations. Use fakes
and moves to beat a player to get past the defender. Accelerate after a
move to get away from the defender.

Progressions: Change to one small central goal to make it harder for
attackers. Play with one player from each team man-marking the other.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area, with a goal and goalkeepers at
either end. Play with two teams, X and Y, which are stationed to the
side of the area with a small square marked out in the middle. The size
square should depend on the age and level of ability of the group but
should be roughly 5 x 5m or 8 x 8m square.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs, goals.

Description: Each player goes one at a time and makes a pass into the
central square then follows their ball. With their second touch the
player takes a shot at either goal before repeating from the other side
of the square. X’s play against Y’s to see who can score the most goals
in 5 minutes!

Coaching points: Correct weight and direction of the pass into the
central square. Shoot using the laces and aim for the corners of the
goal. Follow the ball in for rebounds.

Progressions: Shoot only with the weaker foot. Limit the amount of time.
Allow a player from the other team to close the ball down and apply
pressure to the shooting player.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 30m area, with one big goal at one end
guarded by a goalkeeper and two unguarded smaller goals at the other
end. Three attackers (X players) stand to one side of the goal, with two
defenders (Y players) on the other side of the goal.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs, goal.

Description: The goalkeeper starts with the ball and rolls it out into
the field of play. The X players chase the ball, collect it, turn to
attack the big goal and try to score. Once one of the attackers touches
the ball, the Y players work as a pair to defend the big goal. If the Y
players win the ball they can attack one of the two smaller goals at the
other end, with the X players now defending the small goals.

Coaching points: Work as a team, creating space for a shot at goal.
Encourage movement off the ball. Encourage positive decision making –
when to pass, dribble or shoot.

Progressions: Ask the goalkeeper to throw the ball into different areas
of the field (left, right, or centre) to encourage attacking from a
different area of the pitch. Introduce a first time finish rule to
encourage team play.

SMALL-SIDED FOOTBALL GAMES

Small-sided games are a developmentally appropriate environment for
young players to learn and improve. Each game incorporates a specific
football technique such as dribbling, passing or shooting, or focuses on
team play and strategies such as defending, attacking, creating space or
switching play. These games are specifically designed to bring the best
out of players in realistic match situations. By allowing the players to
enjoy more playing time, their understanding of the importance of team
play, relative positional sense and decision making will be greatly
improved.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 25 x 25m area, with teams set up 4 v 4.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football.

Description: Teams play 4 v 4 inside the area but the players also work
as individuals. Each time a player makes a successful pass they call out
a number, ‘one’ for the first, ‘two’ for the second and so on. To win
the game each player on each team must make 10 successful passes. When a
player reaches 10 passes they shout ‘Bingo!’ then continue to play to
help their teammates reach their targets.

Coaching points: Encourage plenty of movement to help the player on the
ball. Players shout out their scores to encourage communication. Only
successful passes count, so use correct weight and accuracy.

Progressions: Increase to 5 v 5 or 6 v 6. Increase number of passes to
15 or 20. Once a player reaches their target they are limited to two
touches.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 25 x 25m area. Two teams of five play 3 v 3 in
the centre and the other two players on each team are positioned at
opposite corners of the area. Create sufficient areas for the number of
players.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: Teams play 3 v 3 inside the area, and are allowed to tag in
and out of the game with their support players on either corner, at any
time. The first team to make 10 successful passes gets a point.

Coaching points: Move around to create space for your team. Use
dribbling skills to keep the ball for your team when under pressure. Use
support players tactically, tag out when you get tired, tag back in when
you are trying to keep the ball.

Progression: The two outside players become support players to make a 5
v 3 when in possession. Limit players to two touches. Allow support
players to move along the outside line of the area.

Organisation: Set out a 50 x 40m area. Arrange players into four equal
teams, one team with yellow (Y) bibs, one with red (R) bibs, one with
green (G) bibs and one with blue (B) bibs.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The object of this game is to keep the ball between two
teams – red and yellow play together, against blue and green. Once a
player wins possession yellow and red work together to try to keep the
ball away from blue and green, however, red players may only pass to
yellow and vice versa. Same rule applies for blue and green. The first
two teams to make 10 consecutive passes win the game.

Coaching points: Encourage movement off the ball. Look up and around to
ensure you pass the ball to the correct team. Encourage communication
between the two teams. Each player’s first touch should take him or her
into a space, away from a defender.

Progressions: Limit players to two touches each time they receive the
ball. Introduce neutral players (with no bib), who play for whichever
team has possession of the ball. Introduce a target player at each end
line; a point is scored when a team manages to pass the ball to one of
these target players.

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 40m area with a central dividing line to
create two 20 x 20m areas. Play 4 v 2 on each side of the centre line
with one ball on each side.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: The four players (X) in each area pass the ball to each
other aiming to keep possession and the ball away from the two
defenders. If the defenders (Y) win the ball, they try to pass it across
the centre line to their teammates on the other side where they continue
to play 4 v 2 but with two balls.

Coaching points: Encourage teamwork – attack as a team and defend as a
team. Try to make accurate passes with the correct weight. Ask players
to communicate and call for the ball.

Progressions: Limit players to three or two touches each time they
receive the ball. Play with four balls, starting with two balls in each
area.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 50 x 40m area. Organise seven X players against
four Y players with four neutral (N) players on each side of the area,
who act as support players and play for whichever team has possession of
the ball.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs.

Description: X players start with the ball: the aim is to keep
possession in an 11 v 4. Once the Y players win the ball it will create
an 8 v 7 scenario. X players need to make 10 consecutive passes for a
point, while Y players only need to make five.

Coaching points: Encourage movement off the ball. Encourage teams to
communicate and call for the ball. Take your first touch away from a
defender and into space. Ask the defending team to pressure the ball in
pairs.

Progressions: Limit the X players to two touches each time they receive
the ball. Every time the ball goes out, re-start with the X team.

Organisation: Set out a 40 x 30m area split into three sections – two
15m sections either side of the central 10m section, the free zone. Two
teams (X and Y) play 3 v 3 in each end area. One football is in play.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football.

Description: The aim is for the X players in one area to pass the ball
to their fellow X players in the opposite area; the passes go through
the ‘free zone’. No players are allowed to enter the free zone. Y
players do the same when they are in possession. The N players are
neutral and play for whichever team has possession of the ball, to
create an overload of 4 v 3.

Coaching points: Encourage movement off the ball. Encourage players to
communicate and call for the ball. Ask players to concentrate on the
quality of their first touch.

Progressions: Add a target player at each end, the aim now is to pass
the ball from your end area, into your teammate’s at the other end and
then to the target player to score. After scoring with one target player
you must score in the opposite end. Introduce a minimum number of passes
before you can score.

midway point and at either side of the area. Organise two teams, X v Y.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: Teams must pass the ball through a gate before they can
score a goal, but if they lose possession they have to go through the
gate again. They may go either way through the gate.

Coaching points: Encourage players to pass the ball. Encourage players
to create space in order to receive the ball. Ask players to communicate
with each other and call for the ball.

Progressions: The team must play through both gates without losing
possession to score. Players must dribble through the gate instead of
making a pass.

Description: X’s play 6 v 6 against Y’s, with the aim of dribbling the
ball through one of the corner goals to score a point. Players can
attack any goal while in possession.

Coaching points: Players should try to create space so that teammates
can score in the wide areas. Try to get the ball wide. Switch the point
of attack where possible.

Progressions: Teams cannot score in the same goal twice in a row. Teams
only attack the two goals at one end/side of the area. Teams only attack

end. Organise the players into two teams – one player from each team
stands in the target area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football.

Description: Each team has to score by passing the ball to their player
in the target zone. Once a goal has been scored, the player who made the
successful pass changes places with the target player. No one is allowed
in the target area except the target player.

Coaching points: Encourage teamwork. Make accurate passes with the
correct weight. Ask players to move in order to create space. Encourage
positive and quick decision making.

Progressions: Pass to target player has to be a first-time pass. Limit
all players to two touches, each time they receive the ball. Put a
player from each team in a larger area to try to defend the target
player. Pass has to be lofted so that the target player catches it.

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 40m area with a goal at each end. Position
players in two rows on each side of the area as shown in the diagram;
each player is given a number.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs, goals.

Description: As the coach calls out a number, the player from each team
with that number runs around the outside of the field and through their
goal and on to the field of play. The coach serves a ball into the
middle of the area. Players must compete to win the ball and attempt to
dribble or shoot the ball into the goal.

Coaching points: Keep the ball close to your feet when dribbling (1 v
1). Shoot using your laces for power. Use your dribbling skills and
moves to beat a player (i.e. step-overs and changes of direction) to
beat your opponent. Work as a team (during 2 v 2 or 3 v 3 progression)

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 40m area, with two 15 x 10m areas on one
side.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, footballs, goals.

Description: Teams play 2 v 2, keeping possession in the two smaller
areas (X v Y). When the coach shouts ‘Change!’ all players move quickly
to the larger area as a 4 v 4 trying to attack the opposition goals, no
goalkeepers. During the 2 v 2, five consecutive passes make 1 point.
During the 4 v 4 the first goal wins, then players return to the 2 v 2
grids.

Coaching points: In 2 v 2, work hard to make spaces for a pass. In 2 v
2, keep the ball for your team by using close control, individual skill
and by shielding the ball. In 4 v 4, play positive (attack minded)
football to attack the goal to score the ‘golden goal’. In 4 v 4, get
players behind the ball and defend as a team.

Progressions: Introduce a first-time finish rule to encourage build-up
play. Play the best of three goals in the larger area. Add goalkeepers.

Organisation: Set out a 40 x 30m area with five small goals placed along
the goal line. Play 5 v 5 with one player from the opposing team
floating behind the goal line.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football.

Description: Play X’s v Y’s, 5 v 5, inside the area. To score points
players pass the ball through one of the small goals so that their
teammate, floating behind the goals, can control the ball. Which small
goal the ball is passed through will dictate how many points that pass
scores, as shown in the diagram. The player who passed the ball now
swaps places with the player behind the goal line.

Coaching points: Players should try to create space so that teammates
can score in the wide areas. Try to get the ball wide. If one side is
congested, try to switch the point of attack.

Progressions: Limit players to two or three touches. Add a defender to
the float player area to try to cut out scoring passes.

Description: The goalkeeper starts with the ball and gives it to any of
the players on their team in their half of the pitch. They then shoot at
the goal at the other end of the area from inside their own half. The
opposing players try to block the shot and the lone player in the other
half tries to convert any rebounds. Players must stay in their own half
at all times.

Coaching points: Use laces when shooting. Aim for the corners of the
goal. Follow in for rebounds. Shoot as soon as an opportunity arises.

Progression: Make five passes in your own half under pressure from the
one defender before you can shoot.

station two ‘lumberjack’ (L) players on each touchline of the area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: Play as a normal 6 v 6 but instead of the ball going out
for a throw-in, players can use the lumberjack players on the sidelines
to keep the ball in play. Lumberjacks can move up and down the touchline
and play for whichever team is in possession to provide width.

Coaching points: Get the ball wide. Play to lumberjacks on both sides,
switching the point of attack. Defend as a team when not in possession
as an attacking overload is created.

Progressions: The ball has to be passed to a lumberjack on each side
before players can attack the goal, encouraging switch of play. A goal
can only be scored from a cross or pass provided by a lumberjack. Limit
all players except lumberjacks to two touches.

Description: Teams play 5 v 5, trying to score in the opposition’s goal.
During play the ball is only allowed to travel around the outside of the
wall and not the centre of the area. Players are allowed to run through
or over the cones, but the ball must travel around the outside of the
line marked with cones.

Coaching points: Get the ball wide. Switch the play in order to attack
from both sides of the field. Be patient and composed in possession –
wait for an opportunity to open up.

Progressions: Allow players to make lofted passes over the cones to
reach the wide players. Decrease the number of cones until you can play
a small-sided game without the wall.

each goal line. Play 5 v 5 in the middle area with one goalkeeper at
each end.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: Play as a 5 v 5 trying to score in the opponent’s goal. A
team can only score if one of their players dribbles the ball into the
goalkeeper’s area where they go 1 v 1 against the goalkeeper. No
defenders are allowed in the area. Goals can only be scored in the end
area.

Coaching points: Play as a team, spreading wide and deep to create space
in the central area. Try to stay composed when 1 v 1 and attacking the
goalkeeper. Aim to place the ball into the corners away from the
goalkeeper.

Progressions: Attacker is limited to three touches when they enter the
end zone. Allow one defender into the end zone to put extra pressure on
the attacker. Attacker may only have a one-touch rebound if the
goalkeeper makes a save.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 40m area. Play 5 v 5 or 6 v 6 inside the
area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: Play as a 5 v 5 but points are scored per consecutive pass.
1 pass = 1 point, 2 passes = 2 points and so on. A goal = 5 points, and
combination play is encouraged, e.g. 2 passes and a goal = 7 points. The
first team to 21 points wins.

Coaching points: Create space to make passing easier. Look to make
accurate passes to score extra points. Shoot at goal whenever you have
the chance to get maximum points. Apply pressure to the ball when not in
possession to limit points scored by the other team.

Progressions: Limit players to two or three touches. Add first-time
finish rule.

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 40m area. Arrange players into a 4 v 4 with
goalkeepers inside the area with the goals at either end moved 10m
forward into the playing area so there is space to play behind each
goal.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football.

Description: Play 4 v 4, with goalkeepers, with teams attacking either
end. Teams may play behind each goal and are able to attempt to score
from either the front or the back of the goal.

Coaching points: Play wide and around the goal to create an attack from
another angle. Defending team need to have awareness of attacks coming
from different areas of the pitch. Be alive to any rebounds or if the
ball comes through from behind the goal.

Progressions: Make the goals smaller to make it more difficult to score.
Teams must make three consecutive passes before attempting to score.
Once a team scores through the front of the goal, they must then attempt
to score from behind the goal and alternate sides each time.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 40m area and divide it into three sections.
Play 5 v 5 plus goalkeepers with two defenders, two midfielders and one
striker in the sections set out as shown in the diagram.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: Teams play 5 v 5 trying to score in the opponent’s goal.
Once the ball has entered a different section it cannot be passed back
across the line, encouraging forward play. For example, if the ball is
played from defence to midfield, it cannot then be passed back into the
defensive third.

Coaching points: Encourage positive, attacking play. Players to make
space in their section by going wide and deep. Defenders try to close
the ball quickly to prevent the forward pass.

Progressions: Allow the player who passes the ball into the next area to
follow his pass and play in the next section. Limit players to a
first-time finish, encouraging team play.

[]

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 40m area, with a halfway line and a small
goal at either end. Organise teams into 5 v 5, no goalkeepers.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: To score a goal all players from the attacking team must
cross the centre line before a shot can be taken. If the defending team
wins the ball they can counterattack, but if the ball goes out of play
or a goal is scored, the coach then throws a new ball into the empty
half of the area.

Coaching points: Get players forward quickly to support the play and try
to score. Get defenders behind the ball to protect the goal. Press the
ball quickly to force an error and regain possession.

Progressions: Add goalkeepers. Introduce a first-touch finish rule.
Limit players to two or three touches.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 20 x 20m area, with four small goals placed in
the four corners of the area. Teams play 3 v 3 inside the area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: The X players attack and try to score in any of the four
goals. The Y players defend but cannot tackle the X players – they are
only allowed to move to cover and block the four goals. Play for 5
minutes then change roles; whichever team scores the most goals is the
winner.

Coaching points: Play with your head up, so that you can switch the
point of attack quickly. Attackers – move the ball quickly to attack the
open goal. Defenders – organise and cover the goals as a team.

Progressions: Limit X players to two touches. Allow Y players to tackle
and if they win possession the X players become defenders. Introduce a
one-touch finish rule.

>>> 23 – 74 – 83 – 84

[]

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 30m area with goals on each side of the
area.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: Play 4 v 4 inside the area with goalkeepers in each goal.
X’s can only score in the top and bottom goals and Y’s can only score in
the left and right goals.

Coaching points: Shoot as often as possible. Hit the target. Shoot using
laces. Try to defend both goals. Change the point of attack by switching
play.

Progressions: Increase difficulty by reducing the size of the goals.
Limit players to two or three touches. Add first-time finish rule.

>>> 49 – 50 – 60 – 78

| session 98            |                       | diagonal passing      |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 40m area with a centre line running from
goal to goal, through the middle of the area separating the area into
two halves.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: The object of the game is to develop diagonal passing in
order to encourage players to create space and movement off the ball.
The team in possession of the ball must make at least one diagonal pass
from one side of the area to the other and across the dividing line of
cones before they can attempt to score a goal.

Coaching points: When a player runs across the field, encourage
teammates to try to exploit the spaces created. Passes and runs should
be diagonal. Players should call for the ball. If the pass is not ‘on’,
the ball carrier should fake to pass and take it himself.

Progressions: Take out the middle line. Limit players to two or three
touches. Attackers can score only from a pass from the other side of the
field and shoot with a one-touch finish.

>>> 52 – 60 – 74 – 87

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 40 x 50m area with two goals 5m wide at each end
of the field as shown in the diagram. Play 7 v 7 in the middle area with
two floating players (N) on the outside of the area. The floating
players play with the team that has possession.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: The object of the game is to score in one of the two
opposing goals. This may be achieved by playing within the area or by
getting the ball wide to a floating player to cross or shoot on goal.

Coaching points: Switch the ball to the weak side (when attacking). Open
up the field by receiving the ball side on (when attacking). Keep
possession by spreading out side-to-side and end-to-end (when
attacking). Defender/goalkeeper on the weak side acts as cover and
support until ball gets there (when defending).

Progressions: When a team has possession, the other team must drop back
two of its players to defend the goal. The floating players are
restricted to two touches. The team in possession can score only from a
cross by a floating player.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 30 x 40m area with two 10m ‘channels’ on either
side of the central area, as shown in the diagram. Position one player
for the X team in one channel, and one player from the Y team in the
other.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goal.

Description: Teams try to score against the opponent by using the wide
zones. Use one player in the channel who must touch the ball at least
once before the side can score. Players cannot score from the wing, but
must pass the ball back into the field of play for someone else to
score.

Coaching points: Passing. Creating space (awareness). Decision making.
Communication (teamwork).

Progressions: Have a neutral player in the zone; this player is on both
teams. Allow one defender into the channel. Restrict amount of time or
distance in the channel.

>>> 49 – 63 – 90 – 101

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| session 101           |                       | wing play             |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

[]

Organisation: Set out a 40 x 60m area with 5m channels along each
sideline. Station one player from each team in each channel. Play 7 v 7
in the central area with a goalkeeper at each end.

Equipment: Bibs, marker cones, football, goals.

Description: The aim is to play through your wide player and try to
score in the opposing goal. Each team has a player in the wide zones
that play 1 v 1 in that area when they receive the ball, acting as a
full back when defending and a winger when attacking. Both teams can
only score from a cross from the wide player.

Coaching points: Get the ball to the wide player as quickly as possible.
Use dribbling skills and moves to beat an opponent when playing 1 v 1 in
the channels. Make decoy runs such as the cross-over or diagonal run to
lose your defender.

Progressions: Introduce a first-time finish rule. Limit players to two
or three touches. Introduce a neutral player who can enter the wide
areas to create a 2 v 1 against the full back.

>>> 51 – 72 – 99 – 100

SESSION PLANS

The following list of numbers relate to the sessions in the book and
shows which games we feel work well together to make up one session. At
the bottom of each page throughout the book we have matched each game
with four others in order to create a full session of games and
practices, which would last for a minimum of one hour. They are listed
again here for you to use as a quick guide.

Passing practices are linked to other passing games and small-sided
games which are based around making passes, and subsequently the same
applies for the sessions which focus on other techniques like dribbling,
turning or shooting.

This is simply a guide, so please feel free to mix and match the
sessions to suit what you feel will most benefit your players and help
them to get the most out of your sessions.

As previously mentioned, the warm-ups tend to work well with all
sessions as they are inclusive games based around movement and mobility.
