                    To my sons Nils and Jens and my wife Isabel, who for several years have gifted me the
                    “free” time to create this book, and to my DFB soccer instructors, trainers, and lecturers
                    Gero Bisanz † (former DFB chief training instructor, lecturer at the German Sports
                    College Cologne, and trainer at the 1. FC Cologne soccer club) and Dr. Gunnar Gerisch
                    (former director of the soccer department at the German Sports College Cologne and
                    lecturer at the Hennes-Weisweiler Academy), who have taught me “the game” at the
                    highest level. But my sincere thanks also goes to my friend and co-author Peter, who
                    knows what it means to work together on this book reliably and constantly for several
                    years.

                    Our great and everlasting respect goes to Eduard Feldbusch, who made himself
                    available day and night for meetings and who rendered our hundreds of hand-drawn
                    sketches into professional graphics with such an unbelievable amount of “soccer
                    feeling.”

                    I dedicate this book to my father Hans-Joachim, who now watches the game of games
                    from the heavenly stands.

                                                                team-tactical measures. To implement
                                                                variable and efficient team play at the
                                                                highest level, teams must be able to
                                                                quickly open up space. In particular, this
                                                                can be done with precise, well-timed, flat,
                                                                hard, and vertical passes.

                    A successful passing game relies on foundations laid by targeted, variable, and
                    intensive training. Training units on the field are extremely important for coaches
                    and players as their teams evolve and try to reach the highest level. In German Soccer
                    Passing Drills, Peter Hyballa and Hans-Dieter te Poel lay the foundation to develop a
                    successful passing game.

                    In this book, the authors examine many types of passes and performance factors that
                    can lay the foundation through training. As such the book German Soccer Passing
                    Drills is a training model and is a true mine of information for any coach.

                    In 2015, the authors Peter Hyballa and Hans-Dieter te Poel published a second
                    German book on the passing game. This work includes contributions from experts
                    of the most diverse areas of performance-oriented soccer and applied sports science.
                    The different perspectives of the what and how in the international passing game are
                    presented using focused interviews; there is also a large number of additional drills
                    and different types of plays.

                    Currently, there is much discussion about the passing game, particularly in professional
                    soccer. Whether it is a tool that makes team play possible or enables the team to keep
                    possession or is intended to create dominance on the field, all of these demands on
                    the passing game are intended to result in winning the game. It can be that simple!

                    But how and with which drills and variations does a coach or instructor, together with
                    young and adult players, develop an attractive and expedient passing game? Is it
                    specifically as a part of soccer training that focuses on the development, improvement,
                    and optimization of performance, or is it all just a matter of talent, even magic, or
                    solely the realization of a plan?

                    Based on individual training practice, ambitious coaches and instructors are always on
                    the lookout for new suggestions as well as validation of one’s own passing philosophy.
                    The authors therefore offer their colleagues a kind of training model for a modern
                    passing game that can provide new ideas for their own training on the field. So does
                    this mean more of the same old self-knitted rudiments and recipes for a modern
                    passing game? Not at all!

                    The book is divided into six chapters, including the foreword by the German national
                    team assistant coach, Hans-Dieter Flick.

                    In chapter 2 the coach and instructor learns about the essential game-theoretical
                    considerations that the training model, the Hyballa/te Poel Passing Puzzle IQ® (see
                    chapter 4) is based on.

                    Chapter 3 focuses on the question of whether a pass, is a pass, is a pass, as is often
                    the mindset in training and instruction and de facto in soccer. This issue is analyzed
                    and outlined based on

                    ■■ the content of chapter 2,
                    ■■ the requirement profiles and specific complexity of soccer,
                    ■■ the necessary emotional control during the passing game, and
                    ■■ the players’ critical thinking ability.

                    In chapter 4, we outline our complex Hyballa/te Poel Passing Puzzle IQ® intended to
                    contribute to the coach’s and instructor’s ever-present quest for the “highest passing
                    quality.” But it also includes additional performance-determining factors and always
                    takes into account the coach’s and instructor’s attention to time spent selecting drills
                    and types of play and collective self-referential communication (of team or rather
                    group). For the players, competition and training play an important role in the desired
                    positive development of fast, precise, variable, and creative passing within the group:
                    There are many small soccer worlds!

                    In subchapter 4, the reader learns why we chose the form of a puzzle and why—see
                    subchapter 4.2—this can be easily applied to practical training using passing grids
                    (framework). In this regard, a lot of emphasis is placed on dovetailing practical training
                    with the game’s situational context. Subchapter 4.2.1 shows how to coach this on the
                    field with the innovative 3-action system.

                    In subchapter 4.3, the reader is presented with 20 types of passes (puzzles) that can
                    be directly implemented on the practice field: organization, process, coaching, and
                    variations. These should be integrated without restriction and combined with other
                    performance-determining factors (e. g., passing fitness). The desired playing creativity
                    that coaches, instructors, and players are meant to achieve in working with the Passing
                    Puzzle® is referred to as “IQ” (passing intelligence).

                    The different parts of the picture, 20 puzzles on the surface and 6 puzzles in the deep,
                    represent the demands of competitive play.

                    The puzzles are presented to the reader in the form of shelves with materials such as
                    in a hardware store. In a well-organized hardware store, these are fully stocked so that
                    someone, whether an amateur or a professional, can pick and choose at their own
                    whim. This image helps the reader to comprehend the material in this book.

                    In this regard the subchapters 4.3.18 (Tiqui-Taca Special—Rondos) and 4.3.20 (Special
                    Goalie Passing With Goalie Trainer Marco Knoop) provide two particularly excellent
                    puzzles with scope and attention to detail that have never been seen before. To this
                    effect the Rondos for perfect compact foot and passing technique and goalie passing
                    for professional goalie training are based on current empirical findings on goalkeeping.

                    In subchapter 4.4 we use our passing and playing philosophy to show how to teach
                    implementation of the same on the field to one’s own team, in this case a professional
                    team, using the example of the narrow 1-4-3-3.

                    Subchapter 4.5 describes, discusses, analyzes, and interprets current insights on the
                    question of how to implement the puzzle pieces in training and condenses many
                    teaching and coaching methods and rules in the passing game into a comprehensive
                    chart categorized by motor, cognitive, and mixed (linked) components. We refer to
                    the individual Passing Puzzles® and the connections with the selected performance
                    factors, technique, tactics (including passing intelligence) and fitness (endurance). By
                    using these methodical components the coach or instructor is able to make his passing
                    training goal-oriented, precise, and always diverse.

                    Chapter 5 offers a simple summary of essential suppositions and complements as well
                    as quotes from colleagues who, in our opinion, have made forward-looking statements
                    on these topics.

                    The book ends with extensive literary references and picture credits. The interested
                    reader can browse here and find additional information for his training instruction. To

                       “I often ask myself: What is this or that team trying to achieve? Do you only
                       want to shoot goals from standard situations? To me soccer is passing, dribbling,
                       combinations, in other words, playing. (…) There are teams who are happy when
                       they win. Here at Barça we have a different passion. We want to play soccer that
                       gets people excited. We will stick to this philosophy, no matter what. (…) In other
                       clubs all the focus is on winning, even in the youth leagues. In our youth teams
                       we focus on learning. There are kids using their heads, passing and playing. Our
                       model is the one Johann Cruyff brought to this club. It’s all about playing soccer,
                       every damn day!”
                       (Xavi, FC Barcelona, quote from Schulze-Marmeling 2013, pg. 165-166)



                    In his article “The Thinker” (2013, pg. 68-69), the sports editor Jörg Wolfrum quotes the
                    former FC Barcelona soccer instructor Gerardo Martino (master coach in Argentina and
                    Paraguay) on the playing style of his former club under Pep Guardiola. Wolfrum uses
                    these appreciatory words: “Technique, possession, superior numbers” and: “Passing is
                    a requirement for good soccer” (2013, pg. 69).

                    Considering FC Barcelona’s average possession of 63% and 600-700 passes per game
                    during the 2008/2009 season, this seems to be a plausible assumption at first glance
                    (see UEFA 2012a, pg. 14). The UEFA’s statistics for the Champions League even show an
                    average possession of 73.3% and 800 passes per game during the 2010/2012 season.
                    These statistics show that FC Barcelona has managed to continuously increase their
                    possession over their opponents during the four years under head coach Pep Guardiola.

                    Pep Guardiola has taken the philosophy of long possession to FC Bayern Munich.
                    Whether or not this soccer philosophy helped him to secure the early Bundesliga
                    championship in March 2014 is still under debate. The April 7, 2014 edition of the
                    sports magazine kicker published statistical information clearly showing that compared
                    to the previous 2012/2013 season, the FC Bayern Munich pro soccer team under its
                    new head coach had undergone the following changes in the Champions League
                    games:

                    ■■ From 54.4% possession during the 2012/2013 CL to 69.8% during the
                         2013/2014 CL.
                    ■■ From 515 passes per game during the 2012/2013 CL to 725 passes during the
                         2013/2014 CL.
                    ■■ From 359 touches in the opposing half during the 2012/2013 CL to 550 touches
                         in the opposing half during the 2013/2014 CL.
                    ■■ One third of the goals conceded by FC Bayern Munich during the 2013/2014
                         season were scored by their opponents on counterattacks. Under the soccer
                         instructor Jupp Heynckes, the team listed this many conceded goals from counters
                         within two regulation playing periods, and no other Bundesliga team can currently
                         top that high number of conceded goals from counters.
                    ■■ Nearly every third corner awarded to FC Bayern Munich is taken with a short flat
                         pass.
                    ■■ On average, FC Bayern Munich’s last defensive line is located near the centerline
                         during possession. That is about 16 to 23 feet closer to the opposing goal than
                         under soccer instructor Jupp Heynckes. This creates more space for fast attacks
                         (especially with up-and-over passes and into-space) for the opposing team.

                    Add to that the parameter for the degree of pass accuracy of FC Bayern Munich in
                    games during the 2013/2014 season in all competitions (Bundesliga championships,
                    DFB Cup, and CL), and you get a pass completion rate of 88.7% in the Bundesliga
                    and 90.3% in the CL. By comparison: Borussia Dortmund has a pass completion rate
                    of 78.6% during the ongoing 2013/2014 Bundesliga season (pg. 45).

                    However, a causal relationship between a constructive possession philosophy using
                    the passing game methods and guaranteed success cannot be established (see UEFA
                    2012a, pg. 14). A current study by Cologne sport scientist Dr. J. Mesters and Bayer 04
                    Leverkusen’s longtime fitness trainer and performance diagnostician Dr. Holger Broich
                    emphasizes this empirical fact. But both sport scientists from the Cologne Sports
                    College (momentum) also point out that in teams like FC Barcelona or Bayern Munich
                    that have a touch percentage of approximately 70%, the playing quality of the team
                    increases considerably, and the likelihood of scoring lots of points goes up tangentially
                    (see von Nocks 2014, pg. 16-17).

                    These findings then beg the question whether high pass completion and possession
                    rates should not, in general, be more likely to form the basis for attacking play rather
                    than being the objective (see FIFA 2011, pg. 63; Eichler 2014, pg. 23). Japan, for
                    instance, had 620 successful passes in a game against New Zealand during the FIFA
                    U17 world championships in Mexico—92% of all the team’s passes (see FIFA 2011, pg.
                    39), and the midfielder Thiago (FC Bayern Munich) set a new world record on February
                    1, 2014 in a Bundesliga game against Eintracht Frankfurt with 185 passes (172 of
                    these to a teammate).

                    However, based on the available statistical data, the great importance of passing play
                    to the quality of a soccer game at present is a given. 1

                    But what does that say about the “essence” of the passing game? Looking at its
                    emergence from a historical game perspective gains insights that can be of particular
                    significance, especially for imparting the essence of passing in training and competition.

                    Arroyo (1992, 2002) points out that with the introduction of a modified offside rule,
                    what used to be a wild and chaotic battle for the ball with considerable physical
                    damage is changing into a game with increasing cognitive aspects. These are reflected

                    in the intelligent learning processes the players use to regard each other and read
                    the ideas of their teammates and opponents. The first offside rule stated that a
                    player is offside only when he is in front of the horizontal line that the ball formed
                    to the touchline (see Raads 2009, pg. 17). The result was that forward or backward
                    passing was not advantageous, and the vigor and willpower of individual players
                    became game-determining parameters. The modified offside rule, on the other hand,
                    incidentally changed the way players moved in space and time in relation to themselves
                    and their teammates. The new technical element, the pass, thereby became the most
                    important design mechanism for anticipating, planning, and implementing. The
                    battle-like game turned into today’s interactive game with its inexhaustible creativity
                    that finds its equivalent in soccer training and competition, especially nowadays, in
                    the communicative character of passing play:


                       “During a game all players must speak the same soccer language (…). That means
                       that the pass cannot be viewed as just a technical-tactical skill, but also as social
                       interaction and nonverbal communication with a teammate.”
                       (Wein 2004, pg. 7)2



                    The following example from recent Bundesliga history supports this assertion. At age
                    34 and after a nearly six-month hiatus from competing, the former Leverkusen fullback
                    and nine-time national team player Manuel

                    Friedrich briefly came in as a sub in a game against the reigning German Champion
                    and Champions League winner FC Bayern Munich. On November 25, 2013, the
                    Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung analyzed his playing effort as follows:

                    “The lack of playing practice was apparent whenever Friedrich had his foot on the
                    ball, when he was supposed to contribute to the game build-up. In those moments he

                    seemed quite overwhelmed. ‘I didn’t have the same ideas as my teammates. At times it
                    looked pretty ghastly. But I fought my way into the game and it got better with every
                    tackle. My timing is back and defensively I did alright.’”

                    In this context, the implementation of the offside rule is more evidence of how rule
                    changes with a specific intent, in this case limiting delays by the goalie, in recent years
                    resulted in the development of the playing (and passing) goalie (libero).

                    Raads (2009, pg. 18) summarizes the phenomenal importance of the passing game
                    for our soccer game in a very succinct and vivid quote:

                    “The game’s socio-affective character could not be emphasized more plainly. Soccer is
                    about nothing less than collective communication and collective fit. When the chemistry
                    between players is such that the ball makes it into the opposing goal, it is a special
                    achievement of collective nonverbal communication skills. Such special achievements
                    also produce special emotions, namely the exact ecstatic occurrences that can be seen in
                    stadiums among players and fans. When there are frequent misunderstandings between
                    players and subsequently goals by the opposing team and losses, the disappointment
                    is as great as the joy in playing. A game can be won with a single opportune action
                    and can also be lost due to a single misunderstanding. Thus soccer is a reflection of the
                    phylogenetic deeply anchored drive for collective communication ability, and thereby
                    a reflection of the desire for functioning relationships (Bischof 1985). One pre-eminent
                    condition for soccer to be successful is the way people interact with each other and
                    how they FIT together. Fighting together has little chance for success if people aren’t
                    compatible and don’t connect well.”3

                    Lucien Favre, former Swiss national team player and head coach of the premiere
                    league Borussia Mönchengladbach also emphasizes the major importance of having a
                    rapport with others to develop his team’s tactical variability:

                    3 	 This example illustrates that this approach to soccer training has many connections to modern sports educational
                        schemes in Germany. The educational perspective “cooperate, compete, communicate” that is a primary component
                        of play-based learning in educational schemes at schools and universities is established by responding to the needs
                        of teammates during soccer training. Thus soccer training in schools could help require and facilitate the collective
                        communication processes in, for instance, youth competitive soccer, choosing to cooperate and perform via concrete
                        teamwork in a specific situation (see Hänsel/Baumgärtner 2014, pg. 37-62).

                       “But it usually takes lots of time and you must be willing to get to know your
                       players better.”
                       (Quoted by Uwe Marx and Richard Leipold in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Nov. 22, 2013, pg. 29)



                    According to this, the team sport of soccer is primarily about information brokering
                    and processing and personality system interactions, with fundamental motives and
                    different approaches to team or group leadership that the coach or instructor must
                    consider (see Kuhl 2001; Rybicki 2013). It must also be pointed out at this time
                    that the aesthetic component of a soccer game under competitive conditions (and
                    in different cultures) can play a considerable role in observing and analyzing. But
                    because it is multidimensional, it defies rational conceptualities and currently has not
                    been pursued further. Taken as a whole, the cited analysis of topics shows the coaches,
                    instructors, players and students that knowledge and behavior can correlate (see Abel
                    2004, pg. 85). To develop high-quality communication patterns in soccer training, it
                    is generally important that the cognitive content—for example, our passing game—is
                    successfully demonstrated in practice because it can then be learned and automated
                    more quickly by the players (see Spitzer 2006). This can develop into stable patterns
                    that can become a team’s quasi-symbols; for instance, the Fohlenelf (the foals) as a
                    synonym for the fast and successful counterattacking soccer of 1970s Germany, or
                    Tiqui-Taca for the possession and opponent-dominating world soccer in recent years
                    (see chapter 4.3.18).

                    A team’s recognizable symbol can be derived from psychology and interpreted as a
                    symbol with a definite identity because it is based on “successful comprehension and
                    execution of passing performance” (Raads 2009, pg. 45).


                       “We steadied ourselves incredibly fast and worked extremely passionately to fix
                       what happened. The success has helped us.”

                    In addition, it is extremely important for practice and instruction that the Passing
                    Puzzle® (see chapter 4) is complete and geared to technical and tactical abilities and
                    skills, such as offering support to teammates, getting open, and shielding the ball. It
                    is also important that these abilities and skills are practiced and learned consistently
                    as a group (see Roxburgh 2012, pg. 9). The following three examples taken from
                    professional soccer elucidate the necessity of practicing as a group:

                    ■■ “The boys are not satisfied and are working day and night to develop a better
                         mutual understanding and to improve their individual performance.”
                         (Head Coach Benno Möhlmann, FSV Frankfurt, quoted by Helms in kicker, Aug. 8, 2013, pg. 9)


                    ■■ “I don’t have any ready professionals, but rather boys that have to be worked
                         every day because they still have too many unsettled resources” … The open
                         body position, the correct leg, eyes in playing direction – these are opportunities
                         for winning precious seconds. We have to learn to play clean and precise under
                         pressure.”
                         (Head Coach Torsten Lieberknecht, Eintracht Braunschweig, quoted by Bernreuther in kicker, July 22, 2013, pg. 31)


                    ■■ “The one who plays for himself plays for the opposition.”
                         (Helenio Herrera, deceased Argentine soccer coach and creator of the 	Catenaccio; n.y. and w.o.)


                    However, the path to the passing game that reflects action speed, goal threat, and
                    resource economics presupposes “efficient algorithms” based on “dynamic patterns”—
                    dynamic because the game possesses an infinite breadth of “passing elements”
                    that should be developed consciously and unconsciously in the very early stages of
                    soccer training to make a career as a professional player possible (Raads 2009, pg.
                    49, 51). That is why the book’s topics far exceed content-related (and mostly logical)
                    communication between coach and player or player and coach and specifically
                    includes communication problems and their resolution in terms of collective, effective,
                    stable, and progressive action (and the preliminary interpretations of all who are part
                    of a game that continues to evolve). And how do coach and player recognize that
                    communication problems exist? When thinking outweighs feeling and players are
                    more focused on processing their mistakes than a successful pass that facilitates a

                    good subsequent action (e.g., a shot at goal). The following chapters therefore put
                    a lot of emphasis on the situational game derivation of different types of passes
                    that are characterized by pre-, main, and post-actions (i.e., efficient contact) in the
                    sense of theoretical executions. Thus classified, the pass is a function of collective, not
                    individual, behavior within the team that is most often expressed in the flow of play.
                    In this context, under consideration of the perspective of behavioral psychology, Raads
                    (2009, pg. 45-46) emphasizes that in the passing game every player has three roles:
                    the emotional, the dynamic, and the logical role. “[E]ach of these roles has structuring
                    character for the semiotic process of collective behavior.”4


                       “Each player also thinks for the other one and is prepared to take on varying roles,
                       sometimes the water boy, sometimes the star.”
                       (Pep Guardiola, Bayern Munich, quoted by Rybicki 2013, pg. KuS 1)



                    The underlying idea presumes that purposeful behavior occurs through the anticipation
                    of sensory effects (see Hossner 2002). Therefore, the high quality of communication
                    required here is subject to conditions that can have a critical impact on the players’
                    cognition, anticipation, and comprehension processes, especially as concerns soccer
                    training (see te Poel 1984). Such conditions include action-based versus positional
                    orientation and the influence of coaches, parents, instructors, trainers, clubs,
                    associations, fans, advisors, and the media. Consequently, the approach presented in
                    this book is not only subject to a purpose-and-means relationship—take the Passing
                    Puzzle® (see chapter 4.1), and success is yours!—but it is also linked to parameters in
                    the training and continued training of soccer players that facilitate

                    ■■ relationships between the acting people,
                    ■■ long-term setup of a structure, and
                    ■■ continuity and creating meaning.

                    Digression: Applicable here is a recent demand by the captain of the German national
                    soccer team, Philipp Lahm (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Nov. 7, 2013, 259, pg. 24).
                    He demands a fixed position on the national team in the future, which the writer of the
                    article, Christian Eichler, thinks is motivated by the “disloyalty of the coaches.” What
                    does he mean by that? Today’s professional soccer instructors demand “versatility” from
                    their players. For some players, this versatility can also become a “curse,[...]because
                    coaches often love to move these players around while others are rewarded for being one-
                    sided and are always allowed to play in their favorite position.” (Frankfurter Allgemeine
                    Zeitung 2013) What he surely did not consider here are a coach’s methodological and
                    didactic objectives:


                      1. The desire to continuously improve players. This is also true for world-class
                          players. The methodological principle of variability, in this case playing in very
                          different positions, represents a performance-enhancing instrument of choice.
                      2. To create a balance in his team’s game, to make optimal dependability and
                          variability in the course of a game, a season, and a tournament possible.


                    Looking at it this way, coaches aren’t just “…interminably mobile Me, Incs”
                    (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 2013).


                    In addition, coincidence shouldn’t be underestimated in pro soccer, because no soccer
                    philosophy can guarantee success.

                    Memmert/Strauß, & Theweleit (2013, pg. 96) are even able to put an exact number to
                    the coincidence contingent and refer to the current research results by Heuer (2012),
                    Loy (2012), and Lames (1999):


                       Be it as it may, according to the above definition, coincidence plays a part in
                       roughly 45% of all goals […]Other results show that 35% of all touches have a
                       coincident component.”
                       From this, Memmert/Strauß & Theweleit (pg. 97) deduce the following for training and instruction:

                       “In contrast, truly good teams—the best example is FC Barcelona—try to avoid
                       coincidental situations as much as possible. […] The idea is to minimize coincidence
                       to remain as independent as possible of the strange caprices of a soccer god. And
                       you can look at it like this: roughly 55% of all goals are not random. Thus the
                       greater part of a team’s fortune still rests in its own feet.”


                    Regarding the arguably best soccer team in the world at this time, FC Bayern Munich,
                    José Mourinho, head coach of FC Chelsea London and winner of national titles with
                    his various teams in Portugal, England, Italy, and Spain, characterizes outstanding
                    teams as “[…]big teams with a big mindset and fantastic soccer-playing qualities.”
                    (2014, pg. 6).

                       “Having an orchestra with the ten best guitarists, but no pianist, is not a good
                       thing.”
                       (UEFA pro soccer instructor Manuel Pellegrini, Manchester City, in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Oct. 2,

                       2013, pg. 28)



                    When describing and analyzing passing play in soccer, it is often assumed that player
                    A passes to player B. When player A’s ball gets to player B, the coach is satisfied, but
                    not if it’s the other way around! Passing is much more than black-or-white thinking,
                    as can be inferred from chapters 1 and 2. The complexity of the game fundamentally
                    requires players to situationally and without impediment master many types of
                    passes that should be practiced during training in the form of drills and games.
                    And if a player still encounters a coach’s particular playing “philosophy,” as is the
                    norm particularly in pro soccer, that can be expressed in practice and competition
                    through quick switching play, pressing, long possession times, wrong-foot tactic on
                    the wings5, short or long passes, the expectation of the players is for diverse passes
                    with many variations and combinations that have been acquired during professional
                    training for a professional soccer player. If this is not the case, players are faced with
                    a dilemma: Do they “pass” according to the coach’s playing philosophy, or not, and is
                    the player able to, for instance, effectively adjust to multiple coach or club changes?


                    5 	 This means that a left foot plays on the right and a right foot plays on the left side (examples are Philipp Lahm on
                       defense and Arjen Robben on offense). This tactic allows the player a certain amount of unpredictability. He can
                       quickly pull to the inside or is better able to play with the 6/8/10 because he is able to use his preferred passing foot.
                       Coaches and instructors can also use the wrong-foot tactic in youth soccer as a tool to practice playing with both feet.

                    When comparing a coach’s (or club’s) different possible playing philosophies—for
                    instance the FC Barcelona training school La Masia—with a painter’s different paint
                    cans, it quickly becomes apparent that all of his color philosophies are based on the
                    primary colors and many mixed colors. In this respect, the painter does not ask himself,
                    “How do I paint my picture?” but rather, “What do I need to do to depict a topic
                    or problem that is important to me?” He will then supplement the same with the
                    chronological division of his actions and work: “When do I have to mix or apply this
                    or that color?” Only then will he subsequently move on to the “How to,” meaning
                    the painting technique. If we apply this example to soccer training, it becomes clear
                    that for ambitious soccer training a purely technical approach (“How to pass?”) with
                    an exclusively methodological-didactic reasoning falls way short. Meanwhile there is
                    much empirical evidence from game sports research that unequivocally documents
                    implicit and explicit appropriation processes in games work autonomously and at the
                    same time in cooperative or competitive interaction (see Hoffman 1993; Roth 1996;
                    Szymanski 1997: Raab 2000; Memmert 2003). According to Furley and Memmert
                    (2013), the pass “How to” turns into a “Whom should I pass to?”


                       “The more options, the more attentional guidance from working memory.”


                    During training, the players’ decision-making processes should be shaped in such a way
                    that top-down and bottom-up processes are made possible through structuring of the
                    learning situation. In this context, bottom-up processes apply to training the ability to
                    differentiate relevant from non-relevant situational characteristics with instructions to
                    the information sources. Top-down processes involve the player’s options for developing
                    the appropriate methods for structuring the situation, including instructions that help
                    resolve situations in a game or at practice (Furley and Memmert 2013, pg. 204-205).

                    Hence it is the formal training (meaning, our training) that helps develop a diverse
                    and varied repertoire of strategies, skills, and decision-making heuristic techniques in
                    the player so that he is then able to use different situation-specific decision-making
                    techniques to solve the task (e.g., in the sense of an overall playing philosophy) (see




                                                                                                          35

                    Raab 2000). This makes the separation of motility and cognitions obsolete (see
                    Memmert 2003, pg. 232).

                    Furthermore, empirical evidence exists, showing that familiar and stable action
                    patterns (here with respect to the passing game in a broader sense) can be developed
                    via training even in smaller clubs. So the desired precision and speed “[…] develops on
                    its own, as long as the players can rely on their stable and jointly, over time, acquired
                    action patterns.” (Raadts 2009, pg. 262)

                    Thus a pass cannot be just a pass, which is argument for the interim solution that
                    soccer training requirements should be chosen in such a way that

                    ■■ the player is able to experience the requirement profile and the specific complexity
                         of playing soccer,

                    “Because soccer is not always fun, beauty, joy; sometimes it is really rough and requires
                    different abilities.”
                    (The 100-time German national team player Bastian Schweinsteiger, FC Bayern Munich, in a kicker interview with

                    Hartmann, O. & Wild, K., Oct. 14, 2013, pg. 10)


                    ■■ “precipitousness” is checked via emotional control during passing, and
                    ■■ the players’ motivation, distribution, concentration, and teamwork (in the sense of
                         educational perspectives and competencies) during training should be “kept up”
                         with diverse, challenging, and cooperative tasks,


                       “Athletes in a promotion mode produce not only more adequate solutions, but also
                       more original and flexible solutions in sport-specific divergent thinking tasks than
                       athletes in prevention mode… We are able to show that the generation of creative
                       solutions can be optimized through changing the athletes’ motivational states.”

                         can be developed,

                    ■■ the players’ organism can prevent future informational overload (by learning with
                         emotional control) through reinforcement (“I did that well!”) and differentiation
                         (“Next time I need to resolve the situation with a different type of pass!”), and
                    ■■ make sure that the structuring of relevant information via explicit methods
                         particularly in the training of U-teams are subject to prior gathering of extensive
                         action experience .6

                    Furthermore, direct and indirect factors that impact training and instruction must be
                    taken into account:

                    ■■ endogenic biological growth and maturing processes
                    ■■ informational stimuli (motor coordination, perceptive, cognitive), different from
                         physical adaptations (fitness training in general) because physical adaptations can
                         trigger learning processes that take place suddenly (versus additive and successive
                         learning processes) and are organ specific, leading to relatively stable results (see
                         Hossner 2005, pg. 116-131)
                    ■■ historic and cultural parameters
                    ■■ social, environmental factors and personality factors

                    In club practice, those direct and indirect factors determine the desired regular
                    participation in passing. “A pass is not just a pass” therefore means that passing
                    practice places very high demands on target and structural planning in terms of
                    overall training design and management (long-term, mid-term, short-term), because
                    many (and mostly occurring simultaneously) performance factors are activated during
                    the training process. Due to the limited publication, the if and when of integrating
                    chosen topics into active training within the scope of the very complex control via
                    regulatory circuit or block model or a synergetic approach cannot be addressed here.
                    Additional specific methodological considerations and recommendations for training
                    can be found in chapter 4.5.

                    THE HYBaLLa/TE POEL Passing
                    PUZZLE iQ®
                       When Steve Evets asked the famous French soccer player Eric Cantona (formerly
                       of Manchester United) what the most wonderful moment of his career was, he
                       replied: “It was a pass.”
                       (Dialogue from the film Looking for Eric, 2009, directed by Ken Loach).



                    Chapters 1, 2, and 3 emphasize the validity of this chapter’s title.

                    Everyday training experience tells us that soccer training should not be overloaded
                    with too much content and too many methods. This requires set priorities that include
                    other performance factors, such as technique, tactics, fitness, psyche (mindset and
                    creativity), and intelligence, and a playing philosophy in training; these are then
                    coached by the coach or team instructor in individual, group, and team practices,
                    according to the 11v11, 9v9, and 7v7 match requirements.

                    Working as a coach or instructor, it makes sense to visualize different game situations
                    in which “my and the opposing team’s” passing game, with its pre-, main, and post-
                    actions, play a role to find the right fit. When looking at these game situations, it is
                    usually obvious right away that the classic style of two-footed, precise passing with the
                    inside foot to utilize the field’s depth and width is still of foremost importance.

                    But at second glance it also becomes clear that many game situations occur in

                    which that does not happen, and other types of passes that are tools for team-oriented
                    passing become more important—for example, the up-and-over pass or the lob pass
                    (see fig. 2 of the Passing Puzzle®).

                    Like the director of the German Soccer Association (DFB) instructor training program,
                    Frank Wormuth (2011, pg. 43-47), we believe that as many different types of passes as
                    possible should be practiced two-footed and under competition-like conditions again
                    and again in practice, particularly in the targeted and effective promotion of youth
                    training and where playing philosophies are subject to permanent change (all-rounder
                    vs. specialist).


                       “As early as 2007, Joachim Löw made these same arguments regarding our current
                       standings in international soccer. A lack of basic skills: tackles, passing speed,
                       precision, carrying the ball, running speed – elementary, trainable factors!”

                       Löw: “In really big teams these skills are highly developed. The players rarely make
                       mistakes during simple actions!”
                       (Wormuth 2011, pg. 45).



                    For this reason Frank Wormuth demands detail work, as do we, and with respect to
                    training holds firm to the following assertion:

                    “When individual subcomponents don’t work, the entire game doesn’t work.”
                    (Wormuth 2011, pg. 46).


                    The following Passing Puzzle® contributes to the ever-present quest for the highest
                    quality passes. But it always includes attention to the time factor in the selection of
                    drills and forms of play and the self-referential communal exchange (as in a team
                    or group), because: “Every action in its structure is co-determined by previous and
                    anticipated actions […]. The isolated contemplation of an individual action in its
                    present moment is therefore not sufficient […].” (Nitsch 2004, pg. 14.) Having the

                    players experience game and practice plays an important role in the desired positive
                    development of fast, precise, variable, and creative passing play as a group.




                    4.1             WHY a Passing PUZZLE®?
                       “Barça makes the game as simple as possible, breaks it down into its components,
                       the basic parts of soccer, the finely-tuned interplay between ball and legs – an
                       infinite number of short, incisive passes played at the right moment, at the right
                       speed, with the right spin, to the correct foot, to the correct side of the foot. And all
                       of this embedded in the collective movements of a swarm in which each individual
                       always maintains the right distance to all the rest.”
                       (Christian Eichler, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Sunday edition, n.y. and n.pg.).



                    The etymological dictionary of the German language defines the term puzzle as “a
                    picture composed of individual parts” (Kluge 1999, pg. 656). However, the origin of
                    the term is not clarified. Today it has resurfaced in modern English and is defined as
                    “confusion” (Kluge 1999). In Germany its colloquial use is in connection with puzzles
                    and in this context is synonymous with “game of patience” (Duden 1996, pg. 597).

                    But what does the puzzle have to do with the selected Passing Puzzle®? If one takes
                    a closer look at FC Barcelona’s Tiqui-Taca, it is very similar to a game of patience with
                    at times confusing pass combinations, consisting of individual components of one-
                    touch passes combined with triangle passes, angle, and give-and-go passes. These
                    are practiced in competition-like conditions. This way, the players can act in tight
                    spaces without losing possession according to their own or the opponent’s game plan
                    to practice wearing the opponent down, resting while in possession, or preparing to
                    switch play or make a run. 7

                    The situation is the question, the move (here the types of passes) is the answer.

                    7 	 Descriptions and practice-oriented explanations of the names of the different types of passes (puzzles) and performance
                        factors can be found in the practical section of the book (chapter 4.3).

                    Linking the individual types of passes (the “details” = puzzles; fig. 3 with the puzzle’s
                    bottom transparency) with tactical aspects (“What is my/our game plan, and how do
                    I implement it?”) is logical and plausible because:

                    The higher the quality of the individual and team (coordinated) solution possibilities
                    (in the sense of effective behavioral measures), the higher the level of play!

                    Terms are designed to help the coach or instructor make the situational coaching
                    of drills or variations of plays easier for the players in practice and games with the
                    help of soccer-specific, easy-to-understand verbal images and codes (e.g., the “last
                    second pass”). This presupposes that the coach or instructor thoroughly discusses the
                    coaching content and methods with the players and clearly explains the necessity of
                    these specific agreements.

                    Therefore, this book fulfills a pivotal requirement of the DFB’s soccer instructor training:
                    “Training technique from a tactical point of view,” and “Coaching is key!” (Wormuth
                    2011, pg. 46; also see chapter 4.5). But how? The following could be considered
                    examples of situational coaching:

                    ■■ “No opponent in back? Crank it up!”

                    ■■ “Opponent in back? One-touch pass!”

                    ■■ “Behind the opponent? Pre-action: Get out of the cover shadow!”

                    ■■ “Pass into space? Post-action: Go with the ball!”

                    ■■ “Tight space, opponent presses? Tiqui-Taca, give-and-go, and bounce pass, or
                         tight triangle passes!”

                    ■■ “Playing out of the tight space”? Deep and wide switch passes!”

                    As already emphasized in chapter 1, situational coaching cannot be limited to just
                    evaluating solutions that are based on the “if-then rule,” because most often these
                    would result in “do it right/better one way or another” directions from the coach.
                    Group-based action structures as they genuinely occur in a complex passing game also

                    characteristic of the pass: The killer pass is often played as a flat pass, or a pass into the
                    seam, and the up-and-over pass, as the name implies, technically is played as a waist-
                    high or high lob or switch pass. Another example of the close connections between the
                    individual puzzles is the third man play. In practice or a game this requires a triangle

                    8 	 In modern soccer the misdirected pass is still often used deliberately for passes into space. Often the reason for this in a
                        game is to a) allow the opponent to get the ball and then run directly at him and press him, b) speculate on the second
                        ball (e.g., after a defensive header), or c) to misdirect the ball into the opposing corner to buy time just before the end
                        of a game. This special form of play is not subsequently included in the puzzle. The puzzles in fig. 2 and 3 are registered

                    pass, combination pass, or a delayed wall pass. To us coaches and instructors, the
                    reason for this is obvious: We need options for solutions, puzzles, for playing in tight
                    spaces, and we should practice these regularly!

                    If we pursue this train of thought further, to continue this combination the players
                    will use one-touch passes and passes into space because this may be the only way for
                    them to outplay the seemingly well-organized opponent. They must act as quickly as
                    possible in time and space. Thus, nothing is separate in practice and game: The 20
                    selected passes (puzzles) are pieces of a picture we call a competitive game. They can
                    be integrated and combined without constraint. The IQ (passing intelligence) is the
                    desired playing creativity that coaches, instructors, and trainers should exhibit while
                    using the Passing Puzzle®.9


                       “But in top-level soccer minor details that mostly go unnoticed from the outside,
                       often determine victory and defeat. It is all about thinking and acting quickly. I
                       find the mastering of these minor details fascinating.”
                       (The 100-time German national team player Bastian Schweinsteiger, FC Bayern Munich, in a kicker interview with

                       Hartmann, O. & Wild, K., Oct. 14, 2013, pg. 11).



                    Figure 2 shows passing intelligence on the bottom transparency. The abbreviation IQ
                    does not mean an ascertainable intellectual but rather a pointed characterization of
                    intelligent learning processes through training, playing, and coaching in soccer, in
                    which the players, with the aid of the passing game, relate to each other competitively
                    and learn to correctly read the ideas of their teammates and opponents (see chapter 2
                    and especially Guilford [1967] on human intelligence).


                    9 	 Memmert and Roth (2003) differentiate from Guilford (1967) between two separate cognitive thinking mechanisms for
                        game sports training and learning, based on structural similarity: 1. Tactical playing intelligence (convergent tactical
                        thinking in terms of finding the best solution) and 2. tactical creativity (divergent tactical thinking to generate many
                        solutions to problems in specific game situations, that can be seen as appropriate as well as original and surprising
                        (see specifically Memmert 2012a, pg. 38-49). “No, I only listened to my intuition. To me it is important to keep the
                        element of surprise. Everyone always says: Robben goes inside and takes a shot with the left. But it still always works.
                        But sometimes I also go outside and cross. Most important is: Be unpredictable” (Arjen Robben, FC Bayern Munich
                        and Netherlands national team from an interview with Christian Eichler for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Nov. 1,

                    But the Passing Puzzle® would not be complete in some important ways concerning
                    the complex transparency of our competitive soccer game if other performance-
                    determining factors that should not be missed by the coach or instructor’s “passing
                    eye” during practice, and especially practice planning, were not included: passing
                    mindset, passing fitness, passing philosophy (see fig. 3; chapter 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5):


                       “An outstanding soccer talent who thinks that everything will just come to him will
                       definitely be passed up by those with less talent, but lots of self-motivation and a
                       tough mindset. And mental toughness is often the decisive difference.”
                       (Norbert Elgert, U19 coach of FC Schalke 04 and Coach of the Year 2014, in a kicker interview with Müller, T.,

                       April 28, 2014, pg. 79).



                    ■■ Passing mindset is a way of thinking that is often openly critical of the importance
                         of passing in competitive play—particularly in professional soccer training—and
                         that displays the following basic attitude:


                       “…maximum commitment to training and maximum regeneration. […] Being able
                       to make it as a professional requires lots of effort, and even more sacrifice. I said:
                       If you want to enjoy Berlin, find a different job!”
                       (Jos Luhukay, former head coach at Hertha BSC, from a kicker interview with Röser, U. & Beer, J.-J., Sept. 9,

                       2013, pg. 13.)



                    The Dutch world-class coach Bert van Marwijk, vice world champion with the
                    Netherlands national team, characterizes the significance of mindset in professional
                    soccer with the following words: “What matters is a good presence on the field. We
                    must project the mindset of a team that wants to win.” (Quoted from a German press
                    release in the Neue Nassauische Presse, Feb. 1, 2014, pg. 7). With respect to today’s
                    generation of professional soccer players, he makes the following observation in the
                    same press release: “Nowadays hardly any team has individuals who radiate the
                    attitude: This far and no further! in one-on-one duels.” Bert van Marwijk attributes
                    this to the increased media consumption.

                    From the perspective of a world-class player it sounds like this:


                       “There is no better recipe in soccer than work and faith in oneself. This combination
                       opens doors for anyone, everywhere. Young players need to internalize this. Of
                       course there are players who possess fantastic abilities. But they, too, have to
                       work. It just isn’t that obvious. And sometimes there are younger players who
                       don’t see that. They think you either have it, or you don’t. Wrong! You have to
                       prove yourself every day, even in practice. To the coach, the teammates, but
                       especially to yourself!”
                       (Dante, player with FC Bayern Munich and the Brazilian national team, in a kicker interview with M. Zitouni, Dec.

                       2, 2013, pg. 13).



                    But players also have to be ready to think quickly: 1. Pre-action: Be at the ready.
                    Where am I on the field? Where can I help out? 2. Main action: Controlling the ball
                    and passing, or one-touch (relative to the topic)? 3. Post-action: Moving, getting open,
                    feinting, stopping, etc.

                    Where the opponent’s passing mindset is concerned, a high degree of emotional
                    control and frustration tolerance must be practiced when practicing defensive play:


                       “… not getting frustrated when we don’t have a lot of possession.”
                       Head coach Christian Streich of Budesliga team SC Freiburg regarding opponent FC Bayern Munich, quoted in

                       the Frankfurter Neue Presse, Aug. 27, 2013, pg. 7)



                    Behavior plays a significant role, particularly in the practical work with youth players.

                    Recent findings from motivation and stress research now show that “… a person’s stress
                    response is influenced by the interaction between its motivational focus of winning
                    or avoiding losing and the environment” (Schwab 2013, iii). To what extent the coach
                    or instructor must therefore plan and design the scope of passing training in the
                    future so that it corresponds to the player’s regulatory focus and thus enables him to
                    achieve a higher performance is still unresolved, but it is of great interest in regards

                    to goal-driven performance optimization. However, we are unable to further address
                    additional current findings on motivation and stress at this point (see Schwab 2013
                    and chapter 4.5).


                       “No matter what you have achieved, you always have to keep both feet on the
                       ground. To me character and mindset are what is most important in soccer.”
                       (Arjen Robben, player for FC Bayern Munich and the Netherlands national team, from an interview with Christian

                       Eichler in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Nov. 1, 2013, 254, pg. 30).



                       “I like to put the team under a healthy amount of pressure. I have learned that
                       every person performs better with a little pressure. I also put a certain amount of
                       pressure on myself. But it always has to be realistic.”
                       (Bert van Marwijk, former head coach at Hamburg Sports Club and coach for the Netherlands national team, from

                       an interview with Sebastian Wolff in kicker interview, Nov. 18, 2013, 94, pg. 43).



                    After losing several games in the Bundesliga and the Champions League first leg game
                    against Real Madrid in 2014, there was discussion in the national and international
                    press about whether the “possession soccer” played by FC Bayern Munich under head
                    coach Pep Guardiola would be enough to compensate for form fluctuations and mood
                    swings in a top-level team:


                       “Guardiola views success as a question of style. German soccer views success as a
                       question of mind over matter. […] FC Bayern Munich doesn’t need Germany, they
                       need the German spirit.”
                       (Christian Eichler in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, April 28, 2014, No. 98, pg. 23).



                    This example from the game of the current and probably most successful soccer club
                    team in the world also illustrates that the force of will, the mindset, is a mode of
                    behavior that many observers in very successful German soccer consider an important
                    part of soccer culture and a kind of virtuous trait that can help to correct performance
                    fluctuations and successfully engage teams in competitive games “on a par” with “…

                    Allgemeine Zeitung, April 28, 2014, No. 98, pg. 23).

                    ■■ Passing fitness lays the physical foundation for the implementation of the Passing
                         Puzzle®. Studies on players’ position and speed-related data in professional soccer
                         clearly show that the players’ total running distances have greatly increased in
                         recent years and are significantly influenced (p = 0.001) by the playing position.
                         In this context, the outside midfielders and fullbacks cover 10,345 (± 686) m and
                         10,035 (± 477) m during 90 minutes of playing time (see Siegle et al. 2012, pg.
                         280).

                    This is also true for the running intensities in which the two outside midfielders and
                    forwards significantly differ from other playing positions with maximum values of 167
                    (± 87) and 164 (± 69) sprints (see Siegle et al. 2012, pg. 281). Therefore, passing
                    fitness should be included in the puzzle picture, and in addition to the main passing
                    action, pre- and post-action terminology are introduced in the following examples of
                    game situations each coach and instructor must consider during practice (see also
                    chapter 4.2).

                    The passing philosophy refers to the coach or instructor’s soccer IQ and level of
                    knowledge:

                    ■■ Which puzzle is particularly important to the players and me?
                    ■■ Where and when do we have to play with patience?
                    ■■ Where and when do we need to create angles in the game?
                    ■■ Get moving, dribble, pick up the pace!
                    ■■ When to go wide, when to go deep? What does the current situation demand?
                    ■■ Return pass to the goalie, then keep creating passing opportunities for the goalie!
                         Counterexample: A goal scored against Germany after a return pass to Marc-André
                         ter Stegen against the US in 2013. Elements like these sometimes become symbolic
                         of the competitive play of one’s own team (e.g., steady buildup vs. fast counters).
                         The individual playing philosophies should be compatible with those of the club
                         because in difficult athletic situations the coach’s or instructor’s authenticity and

                         the advancement of the club are always subject to negotiation. Ideally a club has
                         a consistent passing philosophy (see chapter 4.4).

                    This means that the players are able to understand (and thus more effectively learn)
                    the passing philosophy, especially in youth soccer.

                    During competitive play the coach, instructor, and player are able to see in real time
                    what the pass picture looks like. The target performance comparison (including
                    situational peculiarities) enables the coach or instructor to constantly continue to
                    “paint” the picture or to discard it and start a new picture. The colors for this, in keeping
                    with the imagery in chapter 3, can be found in the well-stocked shelves at the hardware
                    store (see fig. 2). Not only are there 20 different colors (puzzles) available for sale and
                    use here, but also six examples of possible “styles” (key performance elements) that can
                    be freely combined by the coach (bottom transparency; see fig. 3). This approach is put
                    into practice in subchapter 4.3.1 with the assignment of “styles” to the 20 puzzles and
                    the many practice and teaching methods.

                       “Their passes became more precise and the positions became more and more
                       difficult to figure out, the running paths practically flowed into each other without
                       requiring any commands.”
                       (Sports writer Richard Leipold in his article “The Bavarians’ paths are bottomless,” Frankfurter Allgemeine

                       Zeitung, Sept. 23, 2013, pg. 15).



                    Since the days of Johan Cruijff, Louis van Gaal, and Pep Guardiola we have learned
                    that soccer on the field is always about areas that must be manned in order to be able
                    to promptly press, surround, or put pressure on the ball (cover the field). In this regard
                    the distances of the players to each other are extremely important, and all players
                    must be ready to actively play (see Hyballa and te Poel 2013, pg. 78-79). For example,
                    if one plays in a 1-4-3-3 formation there are occasionally six lines on the field in which
                    the distances between players should be 5 and 10 m (see fig 4 with dot, No. 10, in
                    front).

                                                                                                 Fig. 4: Exemplary connecting lines

                    The result is that players use specific running, passing, and dribbling paths during
                    offense and defense. By contrast, in a 1-4-4-2 formation with a flat four, there are
                    only three or four lines on the field (see Hyballa and te Poel 2013, pg. 78) that create
                    a different geometry on the field and involve different action patterns during offense
                    and defense (covering space) (see fig. 5 with a flat four).

                    Like Pep Guardiola, we also believe that soccer fitness and the mental readiness for
                    everyone defends, everyone attacks can also be practiced in a limited space with lines
                    and zones: “Often Guardiola only plays in one half of the field. The players are supposed
                    to get used to tight spaces. This half is often divided into 16 squares on which the
                    players spread out. There they hold their positions until the playing direction of the
                    ball shows them, which square to move to next. […] That is why he [Guardiola] mixes
                    chaos with order, street soccer with drafting table soccer in his practices.” (Schulze-
                    Marmeling, 2013, pg. 102)

                                                                                with line network (raster) to grid




                    Transferring this idea to a whole playing field (see fig. 6) creates a positional game in
                    zones in which the player is able to intensively practice his positions: “What can I do,
                    and what can I not yet do?” Corresponding tasks will let this structure help the player
                    feel like a fish in water, who knows his terrain and in it learns to pass with precision,
                    speed, and creativity.

                    The examples show that the structure of grids the authors planned represents a
                    regulatory framework for passing practice that can create the direct link to competitive
                    play (and thereby the performance-determining factors) (see fig. 3). On the practice
                    field the grids look like an array of dots (cones) (see fig. 6 with 30 points of contact
                    and 20 fields). The coach or instructor organizes them in such a way that certain
                    temporal and spatial distances can be bridged within the scope of the players’ actions.

                    Of course the passes practiced between the individual cones are not straight and
                    level only because this would not correspond to many game situations, such as switch
                    passes with spin. Considering this perspective, the grid can also be thought of as a

                    dynamic net from the player’s point of view. This means movable intersections formed
                    by the players near the cones. This network structure consists of several independent
                    levels or subnets:

                    ■■ the tangible level: the ball and its condition and that of the playing field
                    ■■ the informational level: the flow of information, the purpose of plays (deliberate or
                         automatic), and the form of the day
                    ■■ the social level: sympathies and antipathies, good vs. bad cooperation partners,
                         kindness vs. resentment, and spectator support

                    The positions of the cones in relation to each other reflect the purpose of the particular
                    drill and thereby represent the basic information that characterizes the respective grid.
                    To the observer this provides a pattern (with a distinctive design, see fig. 4 and 5). This
                    is intended to help the players learn, or rather improve, their basic ability to classify in
                    the sense of the Puzzle IQ.

                    They learn this in practice in the form of a grid taken directly from the players’ point
                    of view and do not have to additionally transfer the information that is described,
                    recognized, analyzed, and interpreted, as is necessary with a simple video analysis
                    from a bird’s-eye view. Additional advantages of the grid for practical training include

                    ■■ predictable practice and instruction;
                    ■■ quick and easy setup;
                    ■■ ability to quickly guide attention;
                    ■■ position-specificity and team building (figuratively sport-specificity/demand
                         profile);
                    ■■ variable emphasis on focus areas in practice/instruction;
                    ■■ targeted coaching (coach/instructor-player, player-coach/instructor, player-
                         player);
                    ■■ individual and group-specific training and instruction;
                    ■■ dovetailing technique and tactics;
                    ■■ developing a passing and playing philosophy by simplifying (manageable space);
                    ■■ quick transfer of video analysis into grids;

                    ■■ quick and simple options for linking different passes with the dribbling and

                         quick and variable) based on the motto: “Doing the dirty work!”

                    The grids will precede the forms of play and are no substitute for spontaneous action

                    When the individual players are running, the player who is not in possession or has
                    just passed the ball plays the crucial role: Will he carry out a post-action, or will he try
                    to retake possession with a skilled pre-action? At times this requires a major physical
                    commitment by the player, but at the same time it also places major demands on his
                    cognitive ability (read situations), anticipation ability, cooperation ability, creativity,
                    and decision-making ability, because: “After the ball is before the ball!”

                    In most cases coaches and instructors demand intelligent running from their players.
                    But what does that mean? Different age groups run differently. For example, children
                    run until they can’t run anymore. Juniors often run in closed spaces on the field but
                    will also expertly let the ball go. Pros move intelligently in open spaces, large or small,
                    that can emerge when ball movement is precise and quick.

                    But how does one practice intelligent running? Many teams practice one-touch soccer
                    in which they focus on the particular passing quality that the coaches are teaching:
                    very good, play hard passes; stay precise and keep possession; not so many turns, take
                    out the step, keep the ball on the ground, only play flat passes to the foot or into
                    space, etc. Taking a look at the game situation, a player can usually keep possession
                    when, in addition to passing play, two other actions take place: the pre-action and
                    the post-action (see photos 1 and 3). Both actions take place at a certain speed and
                    with a tactical focus. When looking at and practicing the passing quality separately,
                    the competitive aspect is missing. With respect to teamwork in general adhere to the
                    words by former Netherlands national team player Arnold Mühren:


                       “It is a thinking game. It is not about running all over the field and slogging away,
                       although it does of course require hard work.”
                       (In Winner, 2008, pg. 194).



                    What does Mühren mean by that?

                    ■■ When the coach or instructor calls for movement in practice, he is not just asking
                         the players to run back and forth, but is also looking for purposeful running or

                         sprinting into appropriate spaces on the field to lay the foundation for quick short
                         passing sequences.
                    ■■ Outstanding teams often have possession because, in addition to their superior
                         passing quality, they carry out lightning-fast actions with the ball (e.g., by
                         immediately dribbling into open space) or close to the ball (e.g., with the intention
                         of making space for a third player or a wall pass).

                    Reaching the level outlined by the coach requires the players to have a wealth of
                    experience and quality. Both factors can already be observed in many younger players
                    in top international leagues who have learned early on to play the game with lots
                    of brains, meaning quickly getting out of the cover shadow, quickly sprinting away
                    from and to the ball to free up a teammate, and playing with heart (i.e., with fighting
                    capacity, dedication, running ability). Therefore, it will remain a coach’s or instructor’s
                    main challenge to improve or optimize the pre- and post-action quality through
                    appropriate coaching—here in the form of the passing grid. The players’ inspiration is
                    referred to by the generic term EXTRA WORK, or in soccer language also called and
                    understood as overtime, extra shift, dirty work, intelligent work, and physical work.
                    Regardless of which generic term the coach or instructor and players choose, it should
                    help the team experience and learn that, for instance, the desire for successful and
                    motivating combination play involves playing short and flat passes that entail EXTRA
                    WORK in practices and games.


                       The mere pass from A to B is out! For us coaches and instructors this means: When
                       practicing passing, don’t just look at the pass but also pay attention to and coach
                       the without-pass actions” before and after the pass. The players’ log will have an
                       entry: Mental and physical disconnect not allowed!” “Always stay tuned in!”


                    The different accentuations in the form of grids allow the coach or instructor to
                    independently plan and implement soccer-specific fitness training paired with different
                    types of passes and other focal points from the lowest to the highest playing level (see
                    fig. 2 and 3). Thus the grid presents an additional means for integrating athletic

                    training into soccer training without lots of additional practice time, equipment, space
                    requirements, and external experts.

                    In retrospect our own training and teaching practice has showed us that forms of play
                    and continuous drills in which players are merely positioned at corresponding cones
                    teaches orientation behavior in a fixed space. But to prevent players from developing
                    static and at times lackluster behavior—behavior coaches and instructors are well
                    aware of—do not continuously use the fixed cone markers in the grid to limit how the
                    players feel for the space.

                    What does this look like in the field?

                    ■■ First use grids with cones and practice the different passing sequences (puzzles)
                         several times in slow motion.
                    ■■ Remove all or many of the cones and explain the task to the players one more time;
                         then let them practice freely.

                    Usually the running, playing, and ball speeds of players who associate cones with
                    constraint and restriction show very little reference to competitive play.


                       “Players want to be encouraged and challenged!”


                    The following quote by Dante, fullback for FC Bayern Munich and player on the
                    Brazilian national team, from a kicker interview with M. Zitouni, Dec. 2, 2013, pg. 12,
                    supports this assertion:

                    “Lucien Favre showed me how to simplify my game, and he was tactically very strong.
                    Positional play and running paths, those were his forte. On the other hand, I credit
                    Heynckes with the great composure in my game. With him I became more certain in
                    my buildup. He taught me to be incredibly calm at the ball. He also was a coach who
                    believed that there is room for improvement even at the highest level, and I liked that.
                    And Pep is a blend of both.”

                    A simple and extremely accessible description and explanation of the sequence and
                    purpose of the grids associated with the EXTRA WORK prior to starting practices is
                    therefore very important, especially for the players:

                    ■■ Compatibility is more than good passing technique.
                    ■■ Counterattack from the opponent, especially the pressure of time, space, and
                         complexity, requires creating open spaces. Most often this can only be done with
                         the appropriate running effort.
                    ■■ Playing combination soccer until taking a shot always means: Keep the opponent
                         moving!


                       When practicing passing, don’t always just look at the pass. The EXTRA WORK is
                       the magic word in coaching!


                    In summary, the EXTRA WORK for planning practices and instruction can be explained
                    with a 3-action system:

                    1. Pre-action: The player runs to the ball or away from the ball or simply stops to
                         get his teammate open. For youth players, in particular, who often just want to
                         keep running (and who are often encouraged to do so to “fight”), this is a type of
                         pre-action that has to be learned. This is also true with regard to taking the open
                         position. By mastering this skill, players, especially in men’s soccer, are able to let
                         the ball do the work. The counterpart to this is the pre-action of taking a closed
                         position. Often an opposing player can be blocked with the help of the closed
                         position, thereby creating space for a teammate.

                    2. Main action: Here the authors differentiate between passing, dribbling, and
                         creating space.
                         a) Passing: The player executes a situation-appropriate pre-action, gets the ball, and
                         plays it on as a one- or two-touch ball, respectively.
                         b) Dribbling: The player sees the open space offered by the opponent and dribbles
                         through it to push the opponent backward.




                                                                                                             61

                         c) Creating space: The player executes the pre-action by running away from the ball.
                         He thereby creates more space for his teammate, who is then able to pass the ball
                         to a teammate relatively unchallenged, or allows the player in possession to dribble
                         the ball through the now enlarged space.

                    3. Post-action: Since the reference point to the ball changes, the player who passed
                         the ball should execute an action. One option would be the running-after action.
                         This does not just mean running after one’s own ball but rather is intended to
                         create spaces to make the opponent run. As previously mentioned with regard
                         to pre-action, stopping can also be an important post-action to provide secure
                         positioning of the remaining defenders or to open up the space (and not run up).

                    The following fig. 7 shows the practical execution of the 3-action system with an
                    example emphasizing post-action.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 5v5 play in a space that is 14 x 14 m.
                    ■■ Behind the 5v2 space, four other cones or markers are set up approximately 6 m
                         apart.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The players play 5v2.
                    ■■ The coaches or instructors specify any restrictions to ball contact.
                    ■■ When a player passes the ball, he immediately has to sprint to one of the back
                         cones (post-action) and then quickly back onto the field because the superior
                         three-man situation should be exploited further.
                    ■■ Playing times: 60-sec intervals and with modified tasks.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The known post-action should not trigger hectic passing play!
                    ■■ Avoid sloppy square passes!
                    ■■ It is best to do a backward sprint to the cone: “Keep an eye on the game!”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ One-touch play to decrease the distance.
                    ■■ Set up cones on the field at a distance of 3 m (for post-action).
                    ■■ Play with a joker who can move in the open space between the 5v2 and the cone
                         for the post-action.
                    ■■ The four cones for the post-actions are marked with two different colors. Red
                         means a long running distance, and yellow means a short running distance. The
                         coach determines the respective tasks.

                    Looking at the statements in previous chapters, the answer to the question posed
                    in the chapter title would have to be no. It is therefore necessary that the individual
                    puzzle pieces are hereinafter

                    ■■ put into a concrete situational playing context,
                    ■■ briefly outline the purpose of the training and instruction, and
                    ■■ present effective and practical examples for the coach or instructor.

                    The question, How do I practice these puzzle pieces?, will be addressed separately
                    in chapter 4.5. The structure of organization, progression, coaching, and variations
                    chosen for the following chapters merely provides a rough pattern that is intended to
                    provide the reader with particularly explicit, comprehensible, and productive material
                    for the first steps into the topics (puzzle pieces). This training and instructional aid
                    provided in advance, also called advance organizer, is meant to organize and structure
                    the content, but it definitely does not discount the readers’ or players’ prior knowledge.
                    The reader should then actively and independently use the inventory of methods (see
                    chapter 4.5) like a building set or a color palette, based on his individual experience
                    and his needs.

                    (1) Technical elements:
                    ■■ Running at the ball:
                          ■■ If possible, approach from behind the ball to be able to pass from an open
                               position (see chapter 4.3.6).
                          ■■ Go into the ball when passing, meaning play the pass flat and with force.
                    ■■ Passing motion:
                          ■■ The toe of the supporting leg points in the direction of the target.
                          ■■ Flat pass: The shooting leg follows through and gets big by using the
                               supporting leg. Coaching: “Get up on the ball of the foot!”, “Keep moving
                               with the shot!”, and “Don’t root your supporting leg in the ground but take a
                               very small hop forward!”
                    ■■ Passing techniques (flat pass):
                          ■■ Inside foot: Frontal passes, short and mid-distance;
                          ■■ Inside instep: Diagonal passes
                    ■■ Outside instep: See inside instep, whereby the shooting leg is in a lateral position
                         to the target.

                    (2) Tactical elements:
                    ■■ Individually:
                          ■■ Breaking away from the opponent or stepping out of the cover shadow and
                               offering support in the gaps.
                          ■■ Offering support for deep passes: going into the gap (e.g., as a 6er, 9er).
                          ■■ Offering support for return passes: Having the gap in front to be able to
                               immediately play a long ball through the gap.
                          ■■ Offering support to the side: facilitating diagonal balls.
                          ■■ Trying to get into the open position (see chapter 4.3.6) to immediately be
                               able to play forward.
                          ■■ Timing: Break away early to receive a pass if the ball is still on its way to the
                               teammate to allow the partner to make a direct pass.
                    ■■ Group tactics:
                          ■■ Wall pass, playing with a third man, long ball with rebound.

                    ■■ Oblique/diagonal balls: Play past the opponent diagonally to the front or back;
                         the receiving player has a gap in front of him and can meet the ball half-open (see
                         chapter 4.3.6).


                         In the following chapters, we also purposefully use mostly familiar soccer language,
                         thereby anticipating an easier and quicker task-oriented transfer to practice and
                         instruction. The figurative language chosen for the different types of passes has
                         been used to date by coaches Hyballa and te Poel in their own practice as collective
                         terminology. The intention is to establish an association between certain symbols,
                         visual characters, and acoustical forms of words, and the objects that create different
                         types of passes, and furthermore to support a team’s communication process.

                               LOB                                             positioned directly in front of the player
                                                                               in possession. The player with the ball
                              PASS                                             urgently wants to pass to his teammate.

                                                                               comparable to lobbing in a tennis match.

                    But often the lob pass is also played when space in the game is very tight (e.g., near the
                    opposing penalty area) and is then played as a final pass to catch the opposing central
                    defenders off-guard. Zidane was a master of the lob pass, a technically ingenious
                    passer.

                    Fig. 9: Lob pass with five in the passing grid


                    Organization:
                    ■■ Five cones are placed in an approximately 30-x-20-m space.
                    ■■ A player positions at each cone so that the passing grid will be completed with 5
                         players.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ A player passes the ball to the opposite player. This player allows the ball to
                         rebound, and the first player lobs the ball over the second player to the third player,
                         who stands opposite him about 15 m away.
                    ■■ The third player plays the lobbed ball directly to the fourth player who stands to
                         his side.
                    ■■ He lobs the ball over the third player to the fifth player, who then passes the ball
                         to the second player, thereby ending the exercise.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Demand body tension from all players.
                    ■■ Demand two-footed lobbing.
                    ■■ The ball must be lobbed hard and with precision so a new play can be initiated.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Only practice the lob pass with a specific passing foot.
                    ■■ Increase the distances and play the lob pass incisively to the teammate’s head.
                    ■■ Simulate game situations: Set up two passing grids next to each other and man
                         them with a total of 10 players. Who finishes the exercise fastest (time, bonus
                         points, etc.)?

                    Organization: See fig. 9.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ See fig. 9, whereby the players in the circles switch positions with their opposites
                         after the lob pass.
                    ■■ After the lob pass all players play the ball with one touch (“Direct play!”)

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Demand, “Play and go!”
                    ■■ After the lob pass all players must orient themselves to the respective new space
                         (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Don’t put too much spin on the lob pass!

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Increase the distances so that a player, for instance in the light-green circle, has to
                         execute several lob passes at a time. He should always run after his own lob pass.

                    ■■ In addition to passing from a closed position, the players also pass the ball to each
                         other the ball from a double-pass situation.
                    ■■ Add one goal with a goalie, and after the lob pass, end the complete action with
                         a shot at goal.

                    Organization: See fig. 9

                    Progression:
                    ■■ As in fig. 9, the player letting the ball rebound immediately becomes the defensive
                         opponent.
                    ■■ By doing this the player receiving the ball can decide if he wants to play offensive
                         1v1 or use the lob pass.
                    ■■ Every player who used the lob pass immediately becomes the defensive opponent
                         (long and short running paths).

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Demand speed and precision from the fast opponent.
                    ■■ Encourage quick or delayed decisions11 (offensive 1v1 or lob pass) (passing tactics).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Increase distances between players to prompt the player in possession to dribble.
                    ■■ Decrease the distances between players so that the players only require one or two
                         touches to make their decisions.
                    ■■ Execute the lob pass with two touches. Lob the ball into the air with the first touch
                         and play it away with the second touch.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ See Progression, Fig. 11
                    ■■ The two neutral players are part of the team in possession. These two players can
                         only play lob passes (ground passes are not allowed).

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Focus on quickly settling and controlling the ball in the 4v4.
                    ■■ The neutral players must be able to determine if the lob pass should be played into
                         space or to the teammate’s foot.
                    ■■ Play additional lob passes with the inside foot (passing technique).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Change the size of the playing field so that the lob passes can be played farther.
                    ■■ The two neutral players play open soccer, whereby only the final assist before a
                         shot can be a lob pass.
                    ■■ The two neutral players are allowed to play ground passes, whereby the goal must
                         be scored with a lob pass. The two neutral players can also score.

                    Fig. 13: 6v6 with goalie—lob passes instead of offensive 1v1


                    Organization:
                    ■■ 12 players plus 2 goalies play open at two goals on a 55-x-30-m fields.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ 6v6 with unlimited touches.
                    ■■ The ball can be moved with a pass.
                    ■■ No offensive 1v1 is played. The ball is played forward, and a lob pass must be used
                         instead of the offensive 1v1.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ When the player in possession is pressured by the opposing players, he must
                         quickly use the lob pass.
                    ■■ The player without the ball should provoke the lob pass and skillfully start into the
                         space to claim it (passing technique).
                    ■■ If the player in possession is overwhelmed, he can also blindly play the ball into
                         the space.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ In the 6v6, the ball is only lobbed, and as soon as it hits the ground, offensive 1v1
                         action must follow.
                    ■■ In the 6v6, only one mandatory touch is played. As soon as a player accepts the
                         ball, he must pass it on with a lob pass.
                    ■■ If a lob pass is played in the game the player who receives the ball must immediately
                         take a shot at goal, making a quick or delayed decision (see Höhner, 2005, pg. 36).


                    4.3.2 THE TRiangLE Pass

                       “The ‘triangle’ clearly shows the passing lines and the decisions the players make.
                       The players recognize this later, in the game situation.”
                       (Louis van Gaal, 2010, pg. 100).




                                                          TRIANGLE
                                                            PASS




                    Triangle passes are done with three players. This type of pass is based on the premise
                    that the second player is aware of the third player to help speed up the game situation
                    (and the game).

                    The three players involved do not always have to be positioned in a triangle. But here
                    we point out that the triangle formation has the following advantages:

                    ■■ deep passes
                    ■■ wide passes (passing technique)



                                                                                                         75

                    Triangle passes presuppose that the player with the ball is able to quickly read the
                    game situation and possesses a solid passing technique to forward the ball unimpeded.

                    The player without the ball must anticipate when to start into the space or remain in
                    his position to receive the third ball (passing intelligence).

                    This makes it apparent that a triangle pass is not just a passing technique (see Bisanz
                    and Gerisch 2013, pg. 332-363), but it also includes What and How questions
                    regarding tactical abilities and skills. The idea behind the triangle pass is this:


                       “Speed up the game or control it!”


                    The following fig. 14 shows a simulated triangle pass situation in conjunction with a

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Six cones are set up in the space so that the distance between the individual cones
                         is approximately 8 m.
                    ■■ The cones can be set up in triangle formations (see fig. 15a or 15b).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Each player positions himself at a cone.
                    ■■ The players play with one ball and should keep the ball moving constantly in
                         different triangle formations.
                    ■■ No square passes are allowed.
                    ■■ The ball can only be passed via the third player, so it is not played to where it was
                         passed from.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Before the player receives the ball, the player without the ball must decide where
                         to pass it.
                    ■■ Before the pass is played to the next row, the player in possession must turn with
                         precision.
                    ■■ “Focus on an incisive and quick passing technique!”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Only play with one touch.
                    ■■ Only play with one or two touches.
                    ■■ The ball can be played back. But subsequently it must be opened to the other side.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ See Fig. 16a and 16b, whereby an additional cone and a player are positioned
                         in the center of the space (central player). This results in two grids of seven with
                         triangle formations.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The players look for the players in the center, who pass the ball on to another player.
                    ■■ The ball can be passed to a player who stands in front of them, or they have to cut
                         outside to speed up the ball.
                    ■■ Practice with two balls.
                    ■■ No player is allowed to remain at his cone, but instead must create space.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The two central players must cut outside.
                    ■■ The two balls in play cannot simultaneously be in the same half of a triangle.
                    ■■ If the two balls in play travel too fast, ball speed must be reduced.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Practice with one ball and call specific passing and running lanes.
                    ■■ Execute triangle passes with position changes.
                    ■■ The coach determines the ball speed: sometimes slow Tiqui-Taca, sometimes quick
                         opening passes (passing philosophy)

                    See fig. 16a and 16b: Grid with seven players without forward-turning actions in the
                    center (no images).


                    Organization: See fig. 15a and 15b.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Both central players only act as rebounders12 who let the ball bounce within their
                         triangle formation.


                    12   Letting the ball bounce or rebound is generally associated with the technique of one-touch play into all playing
                         directions and is linked to the search for a new running path. The interested reader can find practical suggestions in
                         Hyballa and te Poel (2013b, pg. 46).

                    ■■ The outside players, on the other hand, must use the ball to open up the space,
                         meaning: “Play the ball to the other side, too!”
                    ■■ This generates triangle passes that act as opening passes because the central
                         players can only stay in the closed position.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Play the opening pass vertically or diagonally with the appropriate speed (passing
                         mindset).
                    ■■ The central players play a slow ball in preparation to the opening triangle pass.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Practice with one ball.
                    ■■ Add a large goal with a goalie. In this variation, the shot at goal should be
                         integrated as a finish (i.e., final action).
                    ■■ If the coach or instructor wants to set up the triangle with the central players, the
                         lob pass can be interspersed.

                    See fig. 16a and 16b: Grid with seven players in a tight or opening space.


                    Organization: See fig. 16a and 16b.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ See fig. 16a and 16b. The players without the ball must decide if they want to
                         stand in front of the cone (= tight space) that will be the target of lots of one-touch
                         actions, or be ready to receive the ball behind the cone (= wide space) to engage
                         in a game-like 1v1 (cone) with the ball at the foot and then play the triangle pass.
                    ■■ Start the exercise with just one ball.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The player who stands in the wide space without the ball must start straight
                         forward with the first touch.
                    ■■ The player who stands in the tight space without the ball must play an incisive
                         (precise) flat pass with one touch and immediately move back into the open space.




                                                                                                             81

                    ■■ The central players can quickly cut outside as soon as they sense the space is
                         getting too tight.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Instead of a 1v1 (= cone), play 1v1 against a teammate.
                    ■■ A wall pass with a teammate can precede the pass to the third player as an
                         alternative to a dribble action.
                    ■■ Increase the distances to provoke passes after the dribble actions.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 6v4 at two large goals with goalies on a playing field that is 55 x 30 m.
                    ■■ Progression:
                    ■■ The team with the superior number can only pass the ball on to a third player.
                    ■■ The ball cannot be passed back to where it came from.
                    ■■ The team with the inferior number is allowed to play together freely.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The players must see the positioning on the field in width and depth.
                    ■■ Also remember to look across the width of the field.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ High degree of difficulty: The four players can only play triangle passes.
                    ■■ The six players are limited to one or two touches.
                    ■■ Return passes to the goalie are allowed.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ See fig. 17. The objective of this variation is for the player to let the ball do the
                         work.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ 8v4 where the eight players play with only one touch.
                    ■■ The ball cannot be played back to the same player, resulting in play with opening
                         actions.
                    ■■ The team of four can play freely.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Make sure the eight players’ formation is orderly.
                    ■■ Ask for flat passes because waist-high balls mean loss of time.
                    ■■ The team with the superior numbers should prepare each scoring opportunity with
                         precision.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Use time pressure: Every attack must be completed after 15 sec.
                    ■■ Page 87
                    ■■ The playing field is enlarged so more running effort is required (passing fitness).
                    ■■ If a ball is played too high, the team with the inferior numbers gets to take a
                         penalty kick.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Both teams absolutely cannot pass back to the same player.
                    ■■ Both teams always play free and direct. If the first player received the ball, the
                         second player can only play it on with a direct pass.
                    ■■ The ball also cannot be passed in one zone for too long. “Fast ball circulation!”
                         (Passing philosophy)

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Demand positional discipline from the players (passing tactics).
                    ■■ In a one-touch game pre-orientation (e.g., 360-degree view) by players is
                         particularly important to the success of the game concept.
                    ■■ Players should not demand only passes to the foot.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The players who must play with one touch are also allowed to pass back to the
                         passing player.
                    ■■ The clock is running: Every attack must end after 20 sec. During the switching
                         phase, only 10 sec. remain until the shot at goal.
                    ■■ Open play for all players, but the ball must be passed six times before a shot at
                         goal can be taken.

                    ■■ The 6v6 game is supplemented with six neutral players who position behind the
                         goals (objective: provoking a long ball) and next to the field (objective: provoking
                         the wide ball) (passing tactics).
                    ■■ The neutral players play with the team in possession.
                    ■■ The six neutral players get only one touch.
                    ■■ The neutral players cannot pass to the player who passed the ball to them.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Form triangles on the entire field.
                    ■■ Focus on staggering individual parts of the team (passing tactics).
                    ■■ The neutral player must also look across the width of the field.

                         third-man scoring opportunity can be developed.


                    4.3.3 THE sWiTCH Pass

                       “Technique is the spearhead of our basic training, and the foundation for everything
                       else!”
                       (Michael Hordjik, athletic director at Underbouw and technical coach at Ajax Amsterdam; Münster, 2012).




                    In today’s competitive game, the switch pass plays an important role in shifting plays.
                    Because playing space in modern soccer continues to get smaller (tighter), the timed
                    switch pass is a creative means for outplaying the opposing defense (passing tactics).

                    If you take the example of the 1-4-3-3-system with two real wingers, it is immediately
                    obvious that in this system it makes sense to intersperse the switch pass so that the
                    7er and 11er can be used on the wing. Moreover today’s competitive game requires




                                                                                                                                 87

                    the ability to get out of the grip of the opponent’s defensive shifting to the ball with
                    the help of the switch pass.

                    When finding and shifting in open spaces, the switch pass is one of the tools a well-
                    trained soccer player has at his disposal. Furthermore, the appropriate and well-timed
                    wall or diagonal pass is an effective option against an opponent who sits deep or with
                    a changeover (passing philosophy).

                    The following fig. 21 shows a simulated switch pass situation, here played by Toni
                    Kroos, as part of a changeover and shifting play from the inside left to the inside right
                    in the 2012 DFB cup game between Borussia Mönchengladbach (here in white) and
                    FC Bayern Munich (in red/white,) with a 0-0-score (action starts at 1:59 of playing
                    time).

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Four players.
                    ■■ A total of eight cones; four of those are about 40 m apart.
                    ■■ On two sides set up cones 2 x 2 centrally and approxmiately 10 m apart. The
                         players position at the cones.
                    ■■ Set up four cones to the sides of the centrally located 2-x-2 cones, approximately
                         15 m apart.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ One player is positioned at each of the centrally located cones.
                    ■■ The player in the circle has the ball and plays a short pass to the player across from
                         him who lets the ball rebound diagonally into the running path.
                    ■■ The player plays a switch pass to the left or right side (left or right cone) of the
                         pair across from him.


                                                                                                             89

                    ■■ One of the pair runs after the switch pass and plays the ball back to his partner,
                         who then plays a switch pass to the other side.
                    ■■ A player chases down that ball to play it to another player, who then plays a switch
                         pass.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Rebounds from the short passes must be precise in order to properly prepare the
                         switch pass.
                    ■■ Incisive one-touch switch pass; play with both feet (passing technique).
                    ■■ The switch pass should be played incisively, with speed and little spin.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The switch pass is played between the cones positioned at the center and the side.
                    ■■ The switch pass is played with two touches, controlling and passing the ball.
                    ■■ The switch pass should be accepted by a player who plays offensive 1v1 against
                         his teammate and after winning the duel, plays the switch pass back.

                    Organization: See fig. 22.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ See fig. 22. One player accepts the pass from his partner, immediately cuts outside,
                         and plays the ball to the other side with a switch pass.
                    ■■ The other player picks up the ball on the right or left side and lets it bounce off his
                         partner, who then cuts outside.
                    ■■ After each switch pass certain positional changes should be made between the
                         individual pairs.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Prepare your switch pass with a precise cutting (outside) action.
                    ■■ Use both feet to settle the ball and play a switch pass.
                    ■■ Keep up the pace while cutting outside and playing a switch pass.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The ball always stays in the air (perfecting technique).
                    ■■ First cut outside, and then play offensive 1v1 against your partner followed by a
                         switch pass.
                    ■■ After turning away, one player plays a short pass to a teammate who then passes
                         the ball deep to a teammate, who then plays the incisive and hard switch pass
                         (passing mindset).

                    Organization:
                    ■■ A total of eight cones and eight players (see fig. 22), and place the cones at
                         increasing distances.
                    ■■ A player is positioned at each cone.
                    ■■ The player in the circle passes the ball to the partner facing him (see fig. 24) who lets
                         the ball bounce diagonally into the running path of the passing player in the circle.
                    ■■ He plays a switch pass to the outside left or right. The player positioned at these
                         respective corners of the grid passes the ball across to the player diagonally
                         opposite him, who plays a short pass (4) to the player opposite him.
                    ■■ This player then lets the ball bounce back and then plays a switch pass to the
                         outside left or right.
                    ■■ Positional changes immediately take place within the respective group of four so
                         that each player can play a switch pass and must resolve a rebound situation with
                         a passing technique.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Demand quick ball circulation.
                    ■■ Also practice switch passes with the inside instep.
                    ■■ Allow the blind switch pass (passing mindset).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Practice with two balls at the same time.
                    ■■ The outside players at the side are replaced by goalies who can catch the ball and
                         immediately pass it on.
                    ■■ Allow switch passes on the ground (flat).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ See fig. 24, particularly the player who receives the ball with a switch pass and
                         then immediately passes it on to a teammate as a short pass.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Players without the ball should always be at the ready.
                    ■■ Players without the ball do not stand directly at the cone.
                    ■■ Players who receive the switch pass immediately turn into the direction they want
                         to play in.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The ball always stays in the air (very demanding on passing technique).
                    ■■ Only play with one specific foot.
                    ■■ Prior to the switch pass the group of four plays a quick Tiqui-Taca (see chapter
                         4.3.18), and only then play is shifted.

                    ■■ The two sides of the half field consist of 20-m-wide wing zones.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Open play 7v7.
                    ■■ When a ball is played into the wing zone, it immediately must be played into the
                         other wing zone with a switch pass.
                    ■■ Only then can normal play resume.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The on-ball foot immediately plays the switch pass.
                    ■■ One of the players without the ball must immediately get open in the other wing
                         zone so that he can accept the switch pass.
                    ■■ Only play into the wing zones if the game situation permits it.

                    ■■ 6v6 in a tactical formation to be determined.
                    ■■ Four neutral players operate in the wing zones next to the playing field.
                    ■■ The neutral players cooperate with the team in possession.
                    ■■ As soon as a neutral player receives a pass, he must play a switch pass to the
                         players in the other wing zone.
                    ■■ The neutral players accept the ball and pass it back onto the playing field.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Play a high-speed switch pass so a precise and quick shift in play can take place.
                    ■■ Execute a situation-appropriate switch pass so the attacking team can reach the
                         opposing goal more quickly.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ After the switch pass, the receiver dribbles out of the wing zone onto the playing
                         field, creating a 7v6 superior numbers game.
                    ■■ After the switch pass into the other wing zone, an immediate cross in front of the
                         opposing goal must be played from this zone to initiate a shot at goal.
                    ■■ There are no neutral players in the wing zones. Instead one player from each team
                         can operate there so that a switch pass must be won in a

                    ■■ But this switch pass can also be played as an assist for a goal if the situation
                         allows.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The player must anticipate and decide if he wants to play the switch pass as an
                         assist for a goal or as a means to shift play.
                    ■■ If the switch pass is intended as an assist, it must be played very fast and with
                         precision.
                    ■■ If the switch pass is intended as a means to shift play, it cannot result in a hectic
                         pace.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ A goal can only be scored if the switch pass is played into the danger zone.
                    ■■ After the switch pass, a neutral player is allowed onto the field, thereby creating a
                         9v8 superior numbers situation.
                    ■■ Switch passes can only be played with the first touch.

                    Due to the current developments and future prospects in national and international
                    soccer (men, youth, Futsal), the volley is gaining more attention in soccer instruction
                    and advanced training (see chapter 2; FIFA 2010 and 2011; UEFA 2012a and b;
                    Süddeutsche.de 2013). Approximately 37% of all goals in the 2011/2012 Champions
                    League season came from crosses and long balls (UEFA 2012, pg. 10), particularly
                    because crosses and long balls (especially for defense) are becoming much more
                    prominent in modern and future attacking play. Volley passes are

                    ■■ shot at goal with the foot (e.g., after a high cross),
                    ■■ passed with control after an up-and-over pass to a teammate,
                    ■■ used as the next to last pass (see Knievel 2011),
                    ■■ used to clear after a chip pass behind the defense, and
                    ■■ settle the ball, for instance with the chest, to play it on with a flat pass.

                    As can be seen from these examples, the volley in all its facets is very demanding in
                    terms of passing techniques, spatial and temporal pressure (with increased pressing
                    near the goal by the opponent), and the players’ mindset with increasing stress (e.g.,
                    in the danger zone).

                    Here we focus on the volley pass that is played either as a chest pass (see chapter
                    4.3.4.1) or as a lofted pass (see chapter 4.3.4.2) in soccer. For clarity and specificity,
                    the header will be described in detail as a separate puzzle in chapter 4.3.14.

                    4.3.4.1                 THE CHEsT Pass




                                                                                       Dortmund player Ilkay
                                                                                       Gündogan playing a
                                                                                       chest pass



                    This type of pass allows the player to forward the ball with his chest. Forwarding the
                    ball is usually combined with settling and controlling the ball (“Settle it and bring it
                    down to the ground.”).

                    A pass to the 9er in the attacking center is a typical game situation. In this situation
                    the 9er likes to let the ball rebound from his chest to the approaching 10er to develop
                    a direct shot at goal (e.g., shot at goal from the second line, give-and-go, give-and-
                    follow, pass behind the back line) (passing tactics and philosophy).

                    In youth training the coach or instructor should teach the chest pass to be intuitive
                    because many players at the beginning of their soccer training develop a kind of fear
                    of the ball coming toward them at head or chest level. This is because of the body’s

                    natural protective mechanisms and therefore must be taken into account in soccer
                    training (passing mindset).

                    The following fig. 29 shows a simulated chest pass situation at a full sprint into the
                    running path by the FC Arsenal London’s fullback in response to a switch pass from

                    Fig. 30: Grid of four and chest pass


                    Organization:
                    ■■ Set up four cones approximately 25 m apart.
                    ■■ A player is positioned at each cone (four players total).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle passes the ball to the player standing diagonally across
                         from him, who then lets the ball rebound to the teammate with a chest pass. He
                         comes toward the ball, settles it into the new passing direction, and passes the ball
                         to another teammate.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The player without the ball should make some space for himself.
                    ■■ Precision in passing the ball on with the chest so that the subsequent switch pass
                         can be played directly.
                    ■■ Play additional switch passes so that timing and exertion for the chest pass are
                         easier to control (passing technique).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Own assist with the chest and then playing the ball back (see simulated situation).
                    ■■ Own assist with the chest and passing to a teammate who then lobs the ball so
                         that it can be passed with the chest, and only then is the switch pass played.
                    ■■ Competition: Set up two grids side by side. Determine which players play the
                         fastest grid of four (measure the time).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Open play 5v5.
                    ■■ A player stands on either side of each goal. They are extra forwards.
                    ■■ After receiving the pass, the extra forwards must pass the ball on with a chest pass.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The chest pass players must create space situationally so they are able to play an
                         incisive and well-timed chest pass.
                    ■■ The chest pass player must spot the third player before the ball is passed to him.
                    ■■ “Focus on body tension!’

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The neutral player can also settle the ball with the chest and then pass it on: “Ball
                         control is the top priority!”
                    ■■ The neutral player settles the pass with the chest, plays the ball into his own
                         running path, and then plays on the field as the superior number player.
                    ■■ The neutral player does his own assist and immediately tries to score.
                    ■■ The neutral players are positioned at the sides of the field, receive a switch pass,
                         and after doing their own chest pass move onto the field with a fast dribble,
                         creating superior numbers and pressure from the outside (passing technique).
                    ■■ Pairing up: Let the chest pass rebound to the back and create double the superior
                         numbers.
                    ■■ The goalie opens the game with a pass to the 9er (in a formation with a striker)
                         who lets the ball rebound with his chest to the approaching 10er, who can then
                         initiate a shot at goal while facing the opposing goal.
                    ■■ Opening the game via the central defenders or fullbacks, same progression as
                         previous variation.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Form a grid of six in which six players practice.
                    ■■ Distance between outside cones is approximately 8 m; between inside cones is
                         approxmiately 3 m.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle plays the ball (see fig. 32) to the player to his left, who sets
                         up to a player in the center with a short volley pass.
                    ■■ The center player can choose between a volley pass to the player in the circle or a
                         volley pass into the other triangle.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Never wait at the cone!” (passing fitness)
                    ■■ “Not too much spin or rotation on the volley pass!” (passing technique)
                    ■■ Practice with both feet (passing technique).

                    Organization:
                    Five players (plus one supplemental player) practice on one large goal with goalie.


                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle passes the ball to the player on the wing who bounces the
                         ball back.
                    ■■ The player plays a precise cross to the third player in the direction of the back post.
                    ■■ This player plays a volley pass to the player in the penalty box or in the back who
                         finishes.

                    ■■ The player at the back post has the opportunity to score the goal with a volley shot.
                    ■■ Add another large goal with goalie. Attackers actively switch play with a turnover
                          and prevent the defenders from playing at the (additional) large goal.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ On the field the ball can only be played high.
                    ■■ Shots are taken by volley (from the air) and only with the feet.
                    ■■ The neutral players should
                         a. also receive the ball only from the air and keep it up and
                         b. only bring the ball to the ground when they want to calm down” the game.

                    In case of b), a switch pass is played to the goalie on the opposite side and the game
                    continues.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Create spaces!” (Passing tactics)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Open play follows whenever the neutral players take the volley pass low to the
                         ground, meaning the ball cannot bounce on the ground.
                    ■■ 5v3 in which the five players can only play lofted passes and the three players can
                         only play flat passes (passing technique).
                    ■■ If a neutral player plays the ball back onto the field, it is immediately followed by
                         a shot at goal.

                    ■■ 8v8 at two large goals with goalies on one half of a field.
                    ■■ There is a 20-x-15-m deep volley pass zone in front of each goal.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Open play.
                    ■■ A goal can be scored only when the ball is played high into the volley pass zone.
                    ■■ The team in possession must pass the ball high (and without touching the ground)
                          at least once in the volley pass zone.
                    ■■ After that a shot at goal can be taken.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “No blind passes into the volley pass zone, but rather prepare the pass into the
                          volley pass zone!” (Passing tactics)
                    ■■ “Pay close attention to plays to the back post!”
                    ■■ “The 9er must try to quickly go to the ball from the back!” (Passing philosophy)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Shots at goal can be taken from the second line (element of surprise, originality).
                    ■■ Direct kick in the volley pass zone! (Passing mindset)
                    ■■ A point is scored when the ball is passed inside the volley pass zone (second to last

                    ■■ Open play.
                    ■■ A goal can only be scored when the next to last action and the final action, the
                         goal, are played out of the air.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Use chip balls and switch passes as preparation (assists) (passing technique).
                    ■■ Lofted-pass players: “Pay attention to body tension and situational arm and leg

                    ■■ Contrast: On the field the ball is kept high, but to get off a shot, in this case the
                          finish, a flat pass must also be played (high degree of difficulty).
                    ■■ Headers are allowed (creativity).


                    4.3.5 THE nO-LOOK Pass

                       “Liverpool FC could be summed up in just three words: Pass and move!”
                       (Alan Hansen, 2007, n.t. and s.l.)



                                                                    In competitive play, the no-look pass
                                                                    is a type of diversionary tactic for the
                                                                    opponent. The ball is passed in the
                                                                    direction where the player is not looking.
                                                                    This requires the players to be able to
                                                                    distribute and pass the ball unimpeded
                                                                    and with a variable passing technique.
                                                                    Conversely the opposing players must
                                                                    learn to train their ability to split their
                                                                    attention when a player makes a no-look
                                                                    pass (passing intelligence and tactics).

                    Players enjoy trying out techniques and behavior patterns that are new and different
                    during practice or training. This includes disguising one’s true intention—deceit
                    using the no-look pass within the rules of the game. Practice and training should
                    provide players with space and opportunity to develop nuanced perceptual and
                    technical decision-making processes because these also tap into resources that can be
                    advantageous to an interesting and successful game (passing technique and mindset).

                    The following fig. 38 shows the simulated no-look pass situation of the Brazilian 9er
                    in the center of the opponent’s attacking half (here Brazil in white/blue) against the
                    Netherlands (here in red/white) from July 2, 2010, at the FIFA World Cup with a score
                    of 0-0 (start of action at 7:07 minutes of playing time).

                    Fig. 38: The no-look pass in the 2010 FIFA World Cup game between Brazil and the Netherlands


                    The Brazilian player made the no-look pass into the seam (between the two Dutch
                    central defenders). The left winger sprinting into the space was then able to successfully
                    use the open space behind the defensive line for a fast dribble with a subsequent 1v1
                    against the goalie, followed by an assist pass to one of the two teammates moving up
                    (see chapter 4.3.7).

                    The no-look pass made it possible for the Brazilian three-man attacking line to
                    successfully score within 5 seconds against the Netherlands’ five defenders.

                    ■■ A player is positioned at each of the six cones.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ All six players play simultaneously.
                    ■■ Players play with two balls that initially circulate between the groups of three (in
                          the two triangles).
                    ■■ In addition, the two balls should be continuously switched back and forth between
                          the two groups of three, creating passing confusion.
                    ■■ Players should play no-look passes to each other with the two balls to purposely
                          surprise the player without the ball.

                    Coaching:

                    ■■ Players without the ball stand behind or between the cones. By doing so they
                          create more space and are able to dribble again immediately after the no-look pass
                          and then use the no-look pass.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Already think about where you want to play the ball while you are dribbling!”
                    ■■ “Don’t dribble to where you intend to pass the ball!”
                    ■■ “Emotional control (calm) on the ball!”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Execute a no-look feint first and then pass.
                    ■■ After the dribble the coach tells the player where to pass the ball (adding the
                          auditory analyzer).
                    ■■ Practice with two balls.

                    ■■ Every ball played as a no-look pass that reaches the teammate is rewarded with
                         one point.
                    ■■ Five points are awarded if a no-look pass results in a goal.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Only play the no-look pass when the game situation allows it.”
                    ■■ “If the space is very tight, consider a no-look pass.”
                    ■■ “Make sure that the no-look pass does not significantly increase the rate of passing
                         errors.” (Passing philosophy)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Both teams can play at all goals and score there.
                    ■■ The coach, the team leader, or the goalies announce which team can or must play
                         at which goal (adding the auditory analyzers).
                    ■■ If a player scores with a no-look shot, his team is awarded 10 points.

                    ■■ Each of the two large goals gets a 10-x-10-m-wide zone marked with cones. Semi
                         circles can be marked as an alternative.
                    ■■ The two pole goals get an 8-x-8-m-wide zone.

                    Progression:

                    ■■ Open play.
                    ■■ When a no-look pass is played into one of the four zones, the player receiving the
                         ball in that zone cannot be attacked by an opposing outfield player.
                    ■■ A 1v1 against the goalie must then follow in the zone in front of the large goal.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Use the no-look pass as a preparatory element for the finish (passing philosophy).
                    ■■ Use the no-look pass if you want to prevent your team from stereotypical attacking
                         play and surprise (and unsettle) the opponent. (passing philosophy).
                    ■■ Play the no-look pass fearlessly (passing mindset).
                    ■■ “Don’t be afraid of no-look passes that initially miss their target!” (passing mindset)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Play with one or two touches.
                    ■■ Play with one or two touches and also with an assist so that after two touches the
                         game can only be continued with a no-look pass.
                    ■■ Five extra points are awarded if the goalie is beaten with a no-look shot.

                    goals! But how to prepare for those? With lots of confident and incisive combinations
                    (combination passes), creative assists, the next-to-last pass (see Memmert, 2013d, pg.
                    103), and playing with the third man (passing philosophy). Moreover, since the 2010

                    “[…] has become instrumental in generating goal threats” (see Memmert, 2013d, pg.
                    103; Knievel 2011).

                    And what does a game look like when a player wants to keep possession because he
                    doesn’t feel like leaving the initiative to the opponent or just wants to be boss on the
                    ball or just quickly reenergize his own team? It has countless flat passes that, paired
                    with the sure ball control and settling, ensure and display the desired flow (passing
                    mindset and tactics).

                    And what does the C-league youth player wish for when he stands in front of the
                    opposing goal? A level ground pass (flat pass) so he can easily and safely push the ball
                    with precision into the goal. After all, the ball is supposed to regularly find the back of
                    the net, and what youth trainer wants to frequently see a waist-high to high, poorly-
                    timed and sudden pass at the start of a soccer career cause tears of disappointment in
                    a player in front of the opposing goal and gloating by the opposing team (along with
                    the coach and spectators).

                    We want to help create a sense of achievement by subsequently bringing in numerous
                    examples for practice and instruction that are meant to motivate regular use of flat and
                    combination passes. This also includes the element of ball control, which, particularly
                    in passing play, is a hinge function whose purpose is the efficient continuation of play
                    (e.g., again with a pass).

                    With respect to ball control in flat and combination passes, getting in the open and
                    closed position plays a central role. The pass sequence with five or the grid of 20
                    are viable options in line with the aspect of repetition of the previously mentioned
                    fundamentals within large practice groups and classes. For the interested reader this
                    information is shown and illustrated below in tables and in compressed form for
                    training purposes (table 1).

                    Fig. 44: Grid of 20 with lots of flat and combination passes from a closed position


                    Organization:
                    ■■ 20 cones are set up in five rows with four cones in each row.
                    ■■ The distance between the five and four cones respective to each other, vertically
                         and horizontally, is approximately 5 m. A player is positioned at each cone (20
                         players total).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Five players in one row are given a colored bib, so four teams with four different
                         colors can be seen on the field.
                    ■■ The five players in each row practice together.
                    ■■ Player 1 in the circle passes the ball to the teammate who lets the ball rebound,
                         and the player in the circle passes the ball to the player after the next player
                         (skipping a row), and so on.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The players should not stay directly next to the cone but move sideways to create
                         a passing angle (a diagonal).
                    ■■ In addition, the pass should not be played to the body but rather next to the
                         playing leg of the receiving player.
                    ■■ Pre-actions are mandatory (see chapter 4.5).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Play with two touches.
                    ■■ Play with two touches and both feet.
                    ■■ The first touch should stop the ball dead (ball should be still) and then be played
                         with the sole of the foot (in the style of Futsal).

                    Progression:
                    See fig. 44 in which the players without a ball wait for the ball in the open position
                    and after receiving it, play it on.


                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Players should not stand directly next to the cone but rather move sideways.
                    ■■ Add modifications: Alternate the on-ball and off-ball playing leg.
                    ■■ Minimize ball rotation; passing speed and precision are desired (passing technique).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ One-touch passing.
                    ■■ Two-touch passing.
                    ■■ Settle the ball, do a scissor (feint), and then pass it on.

                    Progression:
                    See fig. 44 in which the players should not let the ball rebound. Instead they
                    immediately cut outside after the pass to be able to play the next short pass to a
                    teammate.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Quick cut outside and slow short pass!”
                    ■■ Ask for some slow and some quick short passes.
                    ■■ The player without the ball should make some space.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Turn the ball with the sole of the foot and play the pass with the inside foot.
                    ■■ Turn the ball with the inside foot and play the pass with the outside foot (Brazilian
                         passing).
                    ■■ Cut outside, sidestep the cone, and then play the first pass. Motto: Cut, feint, and
                         pass in a tight space!

                    Fig. 47: Grid of 20 with crossover passing


                    Organization: See fig. 44.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Expanded side-by-side team play: Team 1 with team 2, and team 3 with team 4
                         (10-man passing game).
                    ■■ No guidelines. Players look for passing solutions. The coach or instructor does not
                         provide solutions. The players must actively create passing solutions (see chapter 4.5).

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Vary the ball speed.
                    ■■ Pre-action: “Standing by the cone is a No-Go!”
                    ■■ Post-action: “360-degree orientation and always be ready for the next pass.”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Practice in the closed position.
                    ■■ Practice in the open position.

                    ■■ Passing confusion: Here, for instance, player 1 can also pass to player 3 of the
                         other team.

                    Organization: See fig. 47.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Team 1 plays with team 3, and team 2 plays with team 4.
                    ■■ The players stay in their positions next to the cones, but they continue to execute
                         pre- and post-actions (passing fitness and tactics).
                    ■■ The players without the ball must get out of the way as there are always two balls
                         circulating.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Players should be primarily in the open position so they can be aware of both balls.
                    ■■ Vary the passing speed.
                    ■■ Active and audible coaching among players to convey readiness for active support.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The players pass the balls and afterward move to a new position.
                    ■■ Specify different touch limits.
                    ■■ Execute fast sprints after the pass between two cones to initiate passing fitness.

                    ■■ See fig. 47.
                    ■■ The center cones are taken out of the grid of 20 to form a tighter playing field.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Team 1 plays for possession against team 2.
                    ■■ Team 3 and team 4 stand next to the playing field near the cones as neutral
                         players and play with only one touch with the team in possession.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Flat passes are mandatory for all players.

                    ■■ Players without the ball should always get out of the cover shadow.
                    ■■ After a pass the respective player immediately begins a post-action and actively
                         calls for the ball.
                    ■■ Form lots of triangles.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Reverse the rules of play. Intention: Neutral players on the outside calm down the
                         game with unrestricted touches.
                    ■■ In 5v5, the ball cannot be played back to the same teammate (use triangle passes).
                    ■■ Teams immediately switch if the ball is played high.

                    ■■ Team 4 is outside the playing field.
                    ■■ Team 1 and team 2 are not allowed to pass to the neutral players (team 4). They
                         only pass to each other using flat passes.
                    ■■ The superior numbers team plays with only one touch.
                    ■■ When the outnumbered team wins possession, they play together with the neutral
                         players.
                    ■■ The coach can specify a playing period or make a rule that with a turnover, team 1
                         or 2 must immediately switch with the neutral players.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Position play.
                    ■■ Superior numbers must let the ball do the work.
                    ■■ Immediately start counter pressing after a turnover.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Superior numbers team must continuously choose new players among themselves
                         to pass the ball.
                    ■■ Superior numbers team plays with two mandatory touches.
                    ■■ Whenever the outnumbered team is able to keep the ball within their own ranks 5
                         times, they score a bonus point. The same is retained: Which outnumbered team
                         (role change) scores the most bonus points?

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle is in possession and starts to dribble.
                    ■■ The two players next to him execute pre-actions opposite the direction of the player
                         in possession and offer support in an open position.
                    ■■ The payer in possession plays a flat pass to the player on his right who then plays
                         a diagonal flat pass to the third player who is turning around and then passes to
                         the fourth player in the diamond.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Players without the ball must offer their support in a precise, open position.

                    ■■ Position two players in the diamond approximately 10 m apart so that the flat pass
                         has to be played farther and with more force (varied exertion).
                    ■■ The third player in the diamond plays the ball back to the player in the circle so
                         that the ball is played to the fourth player afterward with an opening pass (varied
                         conditions).

                    ■■ See fig. 51 with specified sequence (1, 2 …), in which the first flat pass is carried
                         into a dribble by cutting (see back-four formation) or the player lets it rebound to
                         the inside. The player that is initially skipped (bottom left) verbally coaches this
                         decision: “Rebound!” or “Cut!” If the ball is passed to the right outside, the flat-
                         pass player again coaches the receiving player with “Rebound!” or “Cut!” so that
                         a double-pass can be played.
                    ■■ If the starting position is at least double-manned, the players run after their
                         respective flat passes (permanent position change).

                    Variation:
                    ■■ Change the starting position.
                    ■■ Change the distances between cones.
                    ■■ Change the geometry.
                    ■■ Replace the codes “Rebound!” and “Cut!” with other synonyms (unfamiliar to the
                         opponent).
                    ■■ The final pass takes place as a follow-up action into a small or large goal (with
                         and without goalie), or against a bench or over one goal into another small goal,
                         or the like.

                    Fig. 53: Looking for flat passes to a third player


                    Organization:
                    5v5 with two neutral players on a playing field that is 30 x 30 m and divided into four
                    squares of equal size.


                    Progression:
                    ■■ Open flat-pass play in which the ball can be in one quarter for no more than 5 sec.
                    ■■ The neutral players play with only one touch.
                    ■■ If a team with the two neutral players is able to make three direct passes to a third
                         player, it scores one point.
                    ■■ Determine which team is able to score the most points in, for instance, 4 min.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ If one team scores three points in a row, meaning the opposing team does not get
                         possession, it is awarded a goal.
                    ■■ Use goalies as neutral players (the goalie as sweeper).

                    ■■ Set up four small goals 8-10 m apart (from the square’s touchline) in all directions,
                         and when
                          ■■ a) a point is scored, or
                          ■■ b) a goal is scored (3 points in a row)
                         players are allowed to play out of the square directly at one of the small goals with
                         a fast and incisive flat pass. If the team scores they are awarded another point.
                    ■■ Set up the same way but with increased distance to the small goals in which the
                         fast and incisive flat pass must be played into a teammate’s running path (keep
                         in mind the offside rule), who must then put the passed ball directly into a small
                         goal without difficulty (but with speed). If he scores the team is awarded two more
                         points.
                    ■■ Set up the same way but include large goals with goalie and open finish.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 9v9 at two large goals with goalie on a three-quarter field.
                    ■■ The playing field is divided into four lateral zones.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Both teams play only flat passes.
                    ■■ The ball can only be passed from zone to zone.
                    ■■ Goals can only be scored from the last (offensive) zone.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Ask for lots of cutting actions in the various zones.
                    ■■ Get into the open position as much as is situationally possible to generate lots of
                         one-touch actions.
                    ■■ Teammates should frequently play flat passes next to the player’s body so he can
                         cut quickly and with precision.

                         another zone.
                    ■■ The ball cannot be passed back.
                    ■■ As soon as the ball is passed high, the opponent gets a penalty kick.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The ball can now be played across two zones with a flat pass.
                    ■■ The ball can now also be dribbled into the next zone.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Make quick decisions.
                    ■■ Dribbling must be done at high speed.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Coach or players impose different touch limits (aspects of personal responsibility
                         and independence).
                    ■■ Shot at opposing goal can only be taken after 45 sec; practice composure and
                         domination via possession (passing mindset).
                    ■■ During an offensive changeover phase, the shot at the opposing goal must be
                         taken after 10 sec. (develop train track-mindset).

                    4.3.6.1 FLaT Pass sPECiaL

                    A more differentiated analysis and description of modern passing training are
                    advisable when considering flat-pass play and not just short- and combination-pass
                    play. This is provided in the form of a special.

                    The effective advantages of flat-pass play are obvious:

                    ■■ It facilitates quick passing combinations and the sure and precise path to the
                         finish (e.g., in the danger zone).
                    ■■ Flat passes played into the running path open up dynamic fast pace actions.
                    ■■ It is easier to keep the ball in the possession team’s ranks (securing results, varying
                         pace).
                    ■■ As a result the opponent must give chase (attrition tactic, provoke errors).
                    ■■ High and waist-high passes are very demanding for the receiver in terms of
                         unimpeded and variable settling and redirecting techniques and the situational
                         use and pressure of time, complexity, and precision.

                    The disadvantages of flat-pass play should also be obvious:

                    ■■ Flat passes as alibi passes without tactical purpose and necessary actions. This
                         most often results in a game-impacting loss of time and speed.
                    ■■ Passing techniques that cannot be applied variably, safely, precisely, and at a fast
                         pace facilitate loss of possession. In practice or competition this usually results in

                         c. the timing to the ball (“When must I play the ball?”) possibly becoming
                             uncertain.
                    ■■ After flat-pass play players often stop instead of immediately moving into new
                         positions and offering renewed support (“Play and go!”).
                    ■■ The teammate often receives the flat pass frontally. This eliminates some of his
                         surprise playing options based on just his position relative to the ball: turns, starts,
                         changes in direction.
                    ■■ Scenario: The team entrenches itself on one side of the field with short passes. The
                         opening, hard switch pass does not follow.
                    ■■ One flat pass follows another, but no finishing actions take place.
                    Which drills and forms of play can be used to (selectively) emphasize flat-passes so
                    that play can be positively impacted by the outlined advantages? The following 10

                    Fig. 59: Flat-pass play on two fields—two tactical passing squares


                    Organization:
                    ■■ Five players in each of two passing squares (approximately 10 x 10 m).
                    ■■ The five players in the two passing squares wear bibs of two different colors.
                    ■■ The passing squares are marked at a 15 m distance.
                    ■■ There are two balls in one square.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The players in one square pass the balls directly to each other.
                    ■■ The coach or instructor specifies after several combination passes to play an
                         opening ball to a player in the neighboring square.
                    ■■ The passing player immediately switches to that square (“Play and Go!”).
                    ■■ The players in one square should not randomly position themselves. The coach or
                         instructor will predetermine a specific strategic staggered formation.
                    ■■ The coach or instructor issues additional tasks. Within each square, balls are always
                         passed direct and flat.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Make sure passes are incisive!” (Passing technique)
                    ■■ “Maintain the arranged order on the fields!” (Passing tactics)
                    ■■ The opening pass must be purposeful.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Play with one ball.
                    ■■ Increase or decrease the number of players.
                    ■■ Contrast:
                         1.     Play to the foot.
                         2.     Play into the running path.




                    Fig. 60: Flat-pass play on four fields—four tactical passing squares


                    Organization:
                    ■■ See fig. 59 in which four instead of two passing squares must be marked.
                    Progression:

                    ■■ Now six players play in each square in a (tactical) 3v3 formation.
                    ■■ The players independently control team play and make flat passes into the various
                         squares without changing positions.

                    ■■ Use both feet (passing technique).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Hold on to the ball: 3v3 in the squares.
                    ■■ Use variations with the specified passing techniques (passing technique and
                         intelligence).
                    ■■ Play only flat passes with the third man.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ 4v4 in the middle zone.
                    ■■ 2v2 in the two end zones.
                    ■■ The players in the middle zone should develop and play the killer pass out of flat
                         passes.
                    ■■ The attackers in the end zone should get to the finish as quickly as possible; flat
                         passes should also be used in this zone.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Our motto: If the passing path is blocked, we cut and shift play!” (Passing
                         philosophy)
                    ■■ “Let the ball do the work!” (Passing technique)
                    ■■ “Create space without the ball!” (Passing fitness)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Play with only one touch in the middle.
                    ■■ Use only one touch in the end zones to get to the finish.
                    ■■ Whenever the ball is passed at waist height, the opposing team immediately gets
                         a penalty kick.

                    ■■ Each half of the playing field is divided into two zones.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The ball can only be passed, not dribbled, from one zone to another.
                    ■■ The final shot can only be taken from the last zone.
                    ■■ Flat-pass play is mandatory for all players.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Continue to form triangles!” (Passing tactics)

                    Organization: See fig. 62.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The clock is ticking, meaning there is time pressure with possession.
                    ■■ Attackers must reach the next zone within 12 sec. This also applies to end zones
                         with corresponding finishes.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Look forward!” (Passing tactics and philosophy)
                    ■■ “Play deep!” (Passing tactics and philosophy)

                    ■■ Decrease field size.
                    ■■ Rule: A penalty kick is awarded whenever three waist-high or high balls have been
                         played.

                       recommends to sometimes just blast the ball in. Like Götze did when he brilliantly
                       accepted Müller’s hard square pass and instinctively looked for the quickest solution

                    Organization:
                    ■■ A field approximately 20 x 25 m, depending on the intent of the passes.
                    ■■ Set up four cones at the far sides.
                    ■■ Set up four ice hockey goals (mini goals) in the center of the field.

                    ■■ The players command each other to shoot for the shot-at-goal pass at one of the
                         four ice hockey goals or pass to be ready to accept the ball because the pass is
                         coming.
                    ■■ If the shooter scores, he can immediately keep playing. If he misses he has to run
                         a penalty lap (passing fitness). Have lots of balls available.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ All players are in a state of ball expectation.
                    ■■ Ask for fast reaction with a shot-at-goal pass.
                    ■■ “Decide!” If there is opportunity for an incisive and quick shot-at-goal pass,
                         immediately take it.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Goals are moved farther apart, increasing the risk for the shooter.
                    ■■ Players are behind the cones and must execute a feint (in front of the cone) prior
                         to the shot-at-goal pass.
                    ■■ The players play lob passes to each other and try to kick the ball directly into the
                         goal from the air (volley).

                    ■■ Set up eight cones with one player stationed at each.

                    ■■ Four ice hockey goals and four balls.
                    ■■ The distance between each pair of cones and the ice hockey goals staggered
                         behind them is approximately 5 m.
                    ■■ Distance from cones to ice hockey goal is approximately10 m.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ At an agreed upon signal, the players of a player pair near the goal first pass
                         the ball to the front player opposite them, who settles the ball, turns away, and
                         immediately plays Tiqui-Taca with his partner.
                    ■■ The coach watches the Tiqui-Taca and shouts out “Shoot!” The ball then once
                         again goes to the front player of the opposite player pair, who settles the ball,
                         turns away, and goes into an offensive 1v1 at the ice hockey goal until the finish.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Keep up auditory and visual perception.
                    ■■ Play quick and incisive passes and avoid collisions.
                    ■■ The player who wins the 1v1 must immediately play the shot-at-goal pass.
                    ■■ Mindset: Courage to take a risky shot-at-goal pass.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ After the shoot signal, the player pairs open with a pass to the player pair to their
                         left or right. Make specific agreements, demand synchronicity, avoid disorder.
                    ■■ With the start of the 1v1, the players with the ball can also play at another goal.
                         This forces them to play a longer shot-at-goal pass.
                    ■■ As the players accept the pass after the code word “shoot,” the opposing player
                         runs toward the goal for the 1v1 and makes it smaller. Who will still get off a
                         successful shot-at-goal pass? Hold competitions!
                    ■■ Set up two large goals with goalies in the center of the playing field. The players
                         can also choose to play offensive 1v1 against the goalie.
                    ■■ Additional mini and large goals are set up behind the ice hockey goals at various
                         distances on the field. The players with the ball can also play quick and incisive
                         shots (passes) at these goals.
                    ■■ Use fewer balls (reduce the high degree of difficulty).

                    Fig. 66: Shot-at-goal pass on goals that have been turned around


                    Organization:
                    ■■ 9v9 at two large goals with goalies on one half of a playing field.
                    ■■ Both large goals and goalies are turned around on the field.
                    ■■ The playing field is divided into three vertical zones; the center zone takes up most
                         of the field width.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ 2v2 play takes place in each of the two outside zones, 5v5 in the middle zone.
                    ■■ Only one or two touches are used in the middle zone.
                    ■■ Open play 2v2 in the outside zones.
                    ■■ The red team can only pass to their two red forwards to score. The playing direction
                         is thereby predetermined.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The two forwards should behave in such a way that they are immediately able to
                         play the shot-at-goal pass.
                    ■■ Players in the middle zone should only play the ball to the two forwards when it can
                         also be played as a shot-at-goal pass, otherwise buildup preparation should continue.


                                                                                                           159

                    ■■ Whenever one forward accepts the ball, the other one must create space so the
                         forward in possession can take the shot-at-goal pass.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Open play in the middle zone, and one to two touches in the outside zones.
                    ■■ Play only ground passes, and the shot-at-goal pass must also be flat.
                    ■■ 6v6 in the middle, and 1v1 in the two outside zones.


                    SHOT-AT-GOAL PASS WITH THE GOALS TURNED AROUND II

                    Organization: See fig. 66.

                    Progression:
                    See fig. 66 in which the four players in the outside zones can score with a shot-at-goal
                    pass. This eliminates the obvious playing direction.


                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The four players in the outside zones must now attack and defend.
                    ■■ Whenever the goalie makes a save, the second ball must also be played as a shot-
                         at-goal pass.
                    ■■ Players without the ball should always get out of the opponent’s cover shadow.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Whenever a forward gets possession, he must play an offensive 1v1.
                    ■■ Forwards can only play flat shot-at-goal passes.
                    ■■ If a forward’s shot-at-goal pass misses the goal, he switches to the center (middle
                         zone) and plays in the 6v5. If he scores in this zone with a shot-at-goal pass, he can
                         continue to play with the superior numbers (generate pressure).

                    SHOT-AT-GOAL PASS WITH THE GOALS TURNED AROUND III

                    Organization: See fig. 66.

                    Progression:
                    See fig. 66 in which a player can move up and create superior numbers in the outside
                    zone (offensive 3v2) after passing from the middle zone to a forward. A player in the
                    vicinity of the passed ball can also move up (anticipating situations).


                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Don’t get frantic during the offensive 3v2, but rather keep possession!”
                    ■■ The shot-at-goal pass is taken after the gap has been detected.
                    ■■ Try to fully use the small spaces in the outside zone. Motto: “Spread out in small
                         spaces!”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ If a forward moves up and creates superior numbers in the outside zone, a defender
                         from the center can also move up. This creates a 3-on-3.
                    ■■ If a forward moves up, but the defender can only move up into the outside zone
                         after a 5 sec. delay—motto: “Incisively, confidently, and quickly take advantage of
                         the small window of opportunity during superior numbers play (3v2)!”
                    ■■ In a superior numbers situation, the shot-at-goal pass must be played after 5 sec.
                         The coach also keeps time (see chapter 4.3.4 with the practice example from the
                         Brazil vs. Netherlands game).

                    4.3.8 THE LasT-MOMEnT Pass

                       “Thiago Alcántara do Nascimento caused ecstasy in this unique way when he
                       dispatched a fascinating deep pass with a volley against Eintracht Frankfurt.”
                       (Neue Nassauische Presse, Feb. 6, 2014, pg. 11).




                    Every soccer player and soccer fan is familiar with the situation when a mostly dribbling
                    payer runs diagonally toward an opponent and fakes an offensive 1v1, but actually
                    waits to play the pass until his opponent decides to tackle him, creates a passing gap
                    for a deep flat pass into a teammate’s running path, or a quick and incisive shot-at-
                    goal pass can be taken near the goal (passing tactics).

                    Furthermore, the last-moment pass plays a central role in the game’s transition phases
                    by not playing the ball too soon but rather dribbling it through the space first so the
                    opponent orients himself toward his own goal (cause the defenders to run back).

                    Principle: The more unimpeded a player can advance into the vicinity of the opposing
                    goal, the wider the shooting angle to the large goal and the less time for effective
                    reactions and anticipation. This advantage can also be increased by the possibly
                    retreating goalie.

                    But there are also game situations where the player waits so long to take the pass that
                    the opponent takes that one step forward. Until that moment, one teammate could

                    usually have gotten open and could have been passed to or had a pass played into
                    his running path, and the defender’s opposite movement would not make a successful
                    chase possible (passing mindset).

                    The following fig. 67 shows the simulated situation of dribbling toward the opposing
                    central defender (here Pique in a back three) with the subsequent last-moment pass
                    to the crossing forward van Persie (arc) (here Arsenal London in red/white) against FC
                    Barcelona (here in white/blue) on Feb. 16, 2011, in the Champions League game, with
                    a 0-0 score (start of action at 4:21 min. of playing time).

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 10 cones are set up in a sort of circle of five.
                    ■■ Of these, two cones (blue and red) always face each other approximately 6 m
                         apart.
                    ■■ One player per cone.
                    ■■ Use one or several balls.
                    ■■ Set distances according to training plan.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle stands behind his blue cone and passes the ball to the
                         player opposite him, who lets it rebound.
                    ■■ The player dribbles past his blue cone and then dribbles on toward the player at
                         the red cone.

                    ■■ The player dribbles past him, or rather feints, and then passes the ball in the last
                         second (last-moment pass) to an off-the-ball player.
                    ■■ He settles the ball, turns away, and plays the same sequence again with the
                         teammate at the blue cone.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Approach in a dribble as fast as possible and feint!”
                    ■■ Keep the head up while dribbling and already think about which player to play the
                         last-moment pass to.
                    ■■ “Dribble approach and pass should not be hasty!”
                    ■■ Use code words (see chapter 4.5).

                    Variations
                    ■■ Don’t dribble past the cone but rather toward the cone, then dribble back, and
                         then pass.
                    ■■ Specify certain feints and have the players use them.
                    ■■ The player near the ball moves toward the dribbling player and tries to interfere
                         with the passing path to the off-the-ball player. The player in possession must
                         then decide if he should play the ball right away or in the last moment (passing
                         intelligence).
                    ■■ Playing several balls simultaneously can increase intensity and focus.
                    ■■ Place dummies or large cones in the seams to make the incisive last-moment pass
                         more difficult.
                    ■■ Set up no-get-up-and-go goals at the sides. These can be quickly and incisively
                         played at from time to time with a flat instep kick (motivation and contrast
                         particularly with youth players: “Sometimes you have to rock the net!”).

                    Fig. 69: Grid of three in individual last-moment mode


                    Organization:
                    Five cones, two of which stand closely side by side and one cone approximately 15 m
                    to the side of the four cones.


                    Progression:
                    ■■ One player stands at each of the cones standing side by side opposite him.
                    ■■ The third player stands at the cone to the side.
                    ■■ The player in the circle has the ball at his foot and can decide if he
                         a. wants to dribble toward the cone near the ball and only then pass to the player
                              opposite him standing at the pair of cones, or
                         b. dribble toward the third player and then pass to him at the last moment.

                    If the third player receives the ball, he settles and controls it and dribbles toward the
                    second player, and in the last moment plays a pass in front of him.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Practice as fast as possible!”
                    ■■ “Use both feet to pass!”
                    ■■ Demand lots of feints during dribble approach.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Increase distances between cones and ask for chip and up-and-over balls.
                    ■■ Set up a goal with goalie behind the third player that he can move against and
                         shoot at in the same mode after receiving the last-moment pass.
                    ■■ The third player is the rebounder, so the other two players start a post-action
                         immediately after their last-moment pass (passing fitness). The next action can
                         then be initiated.

                    ■■ The teammate stands opposite him at his cone triangle, approximately 15 m away.
                    ■■ One ball per player pair.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The players stand with the ball at the tip of the cone triangle and dribble to one of
                         the other cones in the triangle.
                    ■■ The players dribble around just one cone and then
                         a. pass the ball to the player on the opposite side or
                         b. continue to dribble and at some point choose the last-moment pass to the
                             teammate.
                    ■■ With the last-moment pass from the passing player, the teammate decides if he
                         wants to
                         a. make space (stay off the ball) or
                         b. start into the ball, cut to the outside, and then dribble the ball to his cones in
                             the triangle.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Take short, small dribble steps to the cones on the ball side and play last moment-
                         passes.
                    ■■ “Keep up the pace!”
                    ■■ “Always stay quick on the ball!”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Only allow step-overs in the cone triangle (ball control, feinting and passing
                         technique).
                    ■■ Only allow Zidane moves in the cone triangle.
                    ■■ “Don’t dribble past the cone but rather pass when you are level with the two
                         cones!”

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 8v8 at two large goals with goalies on one half of a large field.
                    ■■ Set up 10 to 12 cone goals on the one half of a large field.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Players can only play with one to two touches or find one of the cone goals if they
                         want to open dribble.
                    ■■ Players cannot dribble through the cone goals but rather must pass the ball
                         through the cone goals in the last moment. This is worth one point.
                    ■■ If the pass reaches a teammate, it is worth an extra point.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Foster the courage to approach with a dribble (passing mindset).
                    ■■ Foster the courage to take the late pass (passing mindset).
                    ■■ The player without the ball must execute pre-actions. (Motto: “Offer yourself for a
                         possible pass!”)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Now the ball must be dribbled through the cone goals.
                    ■■ Dribble through the cone goals so that you come out exact and very tight against

                    ■■ Mark 10 horizontal zones.
                    ■■ Possibly use colored marking tape.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The players can only pass to another zone if they do it in the last moment before
                         crossing into the next zone.
                    ■■ The players dribble through one zone but cannot dribble into the next zone. They
                         must again pass into the next zone before crossing into it.
                    ■■ The players are now allowed to also play the last-moment pass through two zones
                         (practice longer passes).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ One player from each pair (“Messi”) is allowed to only dribble and then must
                         immediately take a shot at the opposing goal.
                    ■■ The other player from each pair (“Götze”) is also allowed to only dribble, but not
                         during the tactical 1v1 on offense; rather “Götze” always uses the last-moment
                         pass to pass to “Messi” (passing tactics).

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Always keep up the pace on the ball.
                    ■■ “Götze” must give “Messi” the open space for a fast dribble with subsequent finish.
                    ■■ “Messi” must always get out of the cover shadow so that “Götze” can play the last-
                         moment pass.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ When “Messi” is unable to take a shot, he is allowed to stop dribbling and pass to
                         “Götze” (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Create time pressure: Shot must be taken within 6 sec.
                    ■■ Add a neutral player to create 3v2 in which the neutral player can only play one
                         touch.

                    ■■ 11v11 at two large goals with goalies on a large field.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Each player, except the goalie, must play four mandatory touches.
                    ■■ The ball can only be passed to the teammate after the third touch.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Don’t just quickly touch the ball consecutively, but rather use the four mandatory
                         touches to create open space with it (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Use a fast dribble approach and pass in the last moment.
                    ■■ Alternate between fast dribble and ball control while dribbling.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Play a wall pass as the last-moment pass.
                    ■■ If the last-moment pass is a killer pass and results in a goal, the player without the
                         ball may also use only one touch for the finish.
                    ■■ The ball can only be played forward or to the side.


                    4.3.9 THE KiLLER Pass

                       “And yet during the confusion and fog of battle, there were also those who seemed
                       to be guided … directed …seeing something, someone … others couldn’t see.”
                       (Gary Beikirh)



                                                                      The chosen term has nothing to do with the duel
                                                                      to the death. The killer pass is merely a term for
                                                                      the pass into the last zone, the danger zone, before
                                                                      the goal. When a player gets an unimpeded finish
                                                                      in this zone, it is often an indicator for a team’s

                                                                      keeping with soccer lingo, can be deadly.

                    skills, especially considering the center is usually compressed by numerous attacking
                    opponents. The huge amount of pressure on the ball and the blocked passing lanes
                    present a major challenge for the players (passing technique and tactics). Therefore
                    players in possession should learn by using many applicable drills and forms of play to

                    ■■ stay calm in front of the goal in spite of the huge amount of stress (passing
                          mindset),
                    ■■ estimate your own timing as well as the amount of time needed to the running
                          path of the player without the ball (passing intelligence), and
                    ■■ choose the right passing technique.

                    The following fig. 74 shows the simulated situation of Xavi’s flat pass with the outside
                    of the foot (white/blue) through the center of the midfield (skipping one line) to the
                    9er, who lets the ball rebound to the 10er, here Messi (white/blue), who then plays the
                    killer pass just past the opposing central defender (red/white) and into the last zone.
                    This solution to the game situation is also play with the third man. Arsenal London
                    (red/white) against FC Barcelona (white/blue) in the Feb. 2, 2011 Champions League
                    game with a score of 0-0 (action sequence with times: 14:19 to 14:22 minutes of
                    playing time).

                    Of importance is that the entire passing combination up to the fast dribble in the
                    danger zone lasts only 3 seconds.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Set up three cones in a triangle formation with a distance of approximately 8m.
                    ■■ Place three pole goals in between these two triangle formations.
                    ■■ The geometry is specified as point in the back.

                    Progression:
                    In the triangle formation (with point in the back!), the player with the ball is attacked
                    by the player at the blue cone, who is supposed to prevent the killer pass or make it
                    more difficult (competition-related).

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Try to immediately get in the open position!”
                    ■■ “Too late? Focus on playing with the opponent at your back!”
                    ■■ “Play incisive passes at the end of the combination!”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Every killer pass is awarded one point (competition).
                    ■■ Every successful defense against a killer pass is awarded one point (competition).
                    ■■ Increase distances to each other, allowing the players to develop a 3v3.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ 6v6 in a narrow corridor in which the players on the field must look for the deep
                         killer pass (passing intelligence).
                    ■■ Looking for and finding the deep killer pass should also involve the two wingers
                         who can bring the ball back into play with merely one touch.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Incisive and hard passes toward the passing player.”
                    ■■ “Quick and hard combinations among yourselves!”
                    ■■ “In a tight space quickly break away and use body feints!”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The width of the playing field is decreased.
                    ■■ The teams play with two mandatory touches.
                    ■■ Every passing player (with ball) must continue to find another teammate.
                    ■■ The passing players stand on the field (Barcelona-style).

                    Organization:
                    ■■ See fig. 76 in which only two attack zones are marked in front of the two goals,
                         where one 1v1 pair is positioned.
                    ■■ The tight corridor remains in place to continue to encourage the players to play
                         long balls.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Starting position: 6v6 in the middle zone.
                    ■■ The two teams must try to pass to the striker in the respective attack zone.
                    ■■ The two attackers must use individual and group tactics to break away from the
                         two defenders; they should be able to receive the long ball and score a goal.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Don’t rush the killer pass!”
                    ■■ Avoid waist-high killer passes to the two attackers because this makes it difficult
                         to settle the ball.
                    ■■ Depending on the situation, the two attackers can also hold and shield the ball
                         and then pass it to the midfielders who are moving up.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Only the two attackers are allowed to score goals.
                    ■■ Both attack zones are enlarged so that a 2v2 can be played there. The two attackers
                         play with just one touch, so they can take a direct shot at goal.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 7v7 at two large goals with goalies on one half of a large field.
                    ■■ Set up a 20-x-12-m attack zone in front of the two goals in which two attackers
                         play against two defenders.
                    ■■ The wings remain open.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The seven midfielders must place the two respective attackers in effective goal-
                         scoring settings with the help of the killer pass.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Keep an eye on the running paths of the two attackers (e.g., one is coming, the
                         other one is going). Objective: To make space for the killer pass.
                    ■■ Break off when the killer pass does not fit the game situation. Start a new buildup.
                    ■■ Play the killer pass slightly to the side of the teammate.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ 2v1 or 1v1 in the respective attack zone.

                    ■■ When the attacker is able to successfully finish the killer pass at the goal with
                         one touch, the goal is worth three points. Possibly develop this into a competition
                         with a chart to further increase motivation, or let the players develop it (passing
                         mindset).
                    ■■ After a successful long pass, the midfielders are allowed to move into the attack
                         zone to create superior numbers (increase pressure of complexity).

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 7v7 on a playing field that is 45 x 40 m.
                    ■■ The first zone extends from one large goal with goalie to the mini goal and is 25
                         m deep.
                    ■■ The second zone extends from the mini goal (depending on level of play) to the
                         large goal with goalie and is 20 m deep.
                    ■■ The byline at a level with the mini goal is the offside line.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ 7v7 at the mini goal in which a goal is scored when the ball touches the goal net
                         directly.
                    ■■ A goal is also scored when the long ball is played before the offside line (killer
                         pass), and the player receiving the pass controls it and dribbles alone toward the
                         large goal with goalie.
                    ■■ If the killer pass is played before the offside line, the finish at the large goal is
                         worth three points.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The fast and perfectly-timed killer pass must be played out of the narrow space.
                    ■■ The receiving players must make sure they are not offside.
                    ■■ Use the chip ball as a passing alternative to the killer pass.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ 7v7 in front of the mini goal playing with one touch only.
                    ■■ Increase field size to make studying the running paths easier.
                    ■■ Exchange the mini goal for a large goal with goalie.

                         as zones (here in blue).
                    ■■ A goal can only be scored when a killer pass is played into these zones.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Dribble around the blocked passing lanes.
                    ■■ Do not play the ball directly in front of the forward’s feet.
                    ■■ Moreover, also look for and play the pass into an open space to make the forward
                         run.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ If the killer pass into the zone in front of the goal is not possible, dribble alone into
                         the last zone and finish (passing tactics and intelligence).
                    ■■ The killer pass can only be played as a ground pass (passing technique).

                    after a pass up and over the defense (see fussballtraining 2013, pg. 6-7). Why is this
                    becoming more common in a game? Nowadays many defenses play relatively high
                    lines. That means they

                    a. want to get the ball in the first line, and
                    b. keep the opponent far away from the goal.

                    For these reasons an incisive up-and-over chip ball played from a midfield position—
                    this defensive position is usually referred to as the last line—is very effective. The space
                    behind the last line can only be directly defended by the goalie. It therefore makes a
                    lot of sense to think about practicing up-and-over passes during training.

                    The following fig. 81 shows the simulated situation of a diagonal flat pass from a 6er
                    out of the right halfback position in the opposing half (white/blue) through the center


                    14    We use the conceptual pair chip ball, which is used very frequently in everyday practice, in part synonymously for the
                          up-and-over puzzle designation.

                    plays an up-and-over pass over the central defender (red/white) who has moved up
                    and is blocking the direct ground passing lane to the 9er in the center (white/blue)
                    and in behind the defense. This scene stems from the Atletico Madrid (red/white) vs.
                    Atletico Bilbao (white/blue) game on May 9, 2012, in the European League final with
                    a 0-0 score (action sequence with times: 05:00 to 05:02 of playing time).

                    Here, too, we must point out the very brief time period (approximately 3 sec.) between
                    the diagonal flat pass and the up-and-over pass until the finish.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 4v4 soccer tennis on a playing field that is 40 x 20 m.
                    ■■ The field is divided in half by a centerline.
                    ■■ A 15-x-15-m zone (end zone) is added behind each end of the field.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Rules: Only one point can be scored at any time. Exception: The ball is chipped over
                         the four players in either end zone. Then the team is awarded five points.
                    ■■ Players must not stay in the end zones.
                    ■■ If the ball is played into an end zone, the players can run there, control the ball,
                         and try to keep the ball within their ranks.
                    ■■ Adjust the degree of difficulty according to the team’s playing level. That means:
                         a. only volley touches,
                         b. only one touch on the ground per team, and
                         c. variations after verbal agreement.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Continuously ask for the courage to take the chip pass (passing mindset).
                    ■■ Don’t rush the ball into the end zones.
                    ■■ If the game doesn’t permit, just hold the ball within your ranks (passing intelligence
                         and tactics).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The field is enlarged considerably to increase the players’ running performance
                         (passing fitness).
                    ■■ If the up-and-over pass is successful, it is worth an extra point.
                    ■■ The ball can only be chipped into the end zone with a specific foot.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Open play.
                    ■■ The players can only score if the ball was first chipped into an end zone.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Don’t rush to play the last pass.
                    ■■ Players can also play the second ball up and over.
                    ■■ The goalie can then pass the ball into the end zone if the opposing defensive line
                         is too high (passing philosophy).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Play with only one to two touches.
                    ■■ Direct shot at goal from the end zone (passing mindset).
                    ■■ Increase the length of the field so the up-and-over passes must be played from the
                         behind.

                    ■■ An end zone is marked in front of each of the large goals.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Open play.
                    ■■ All players play on the field only (without the end zones).
                    ■■ A goal can only be scored if the ball is chipped over the central 7v7 players.
                    ■■ When a forward runs into an end zone while watching the ball and is not offside,
                         the defending team can no longer pursue him.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The up-and-over pass must be played high above the last defender.
                    ■■ The forwards start to run even though the up-and-over pass hasn’t been played yet
                         (pre-actions, passing fitness).
                    ■■ “Be aware of the offside position!”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ One defender is also allowed to run into the end zone after the up-and-over pass.
                    ■■ The killer (ground) pass is also permitted.
                    ■■ After the up-and-over pass, the ball must be kicked out of the air (volley) into the
                         goal (very demanding passing technique).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The superior numbers team can only play one to two touches.
                    ■■ Players can play only flat and combination passes (passing technique).
                    ■■ The team of five must chip the ball over the superior numbers team as quickly as
                         possible and unnerve the superior numbers team with lots of up-and-over passes
                         and disrupt the flow of their combinations—in other words, provocation (passing
                         mindset and philosophy).

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ One of the attackers on the outnumbered team must continue to start in the
                         direction of the end zone (passing fitness).
                    ■■ Play the chip balls incisively and without being rushed (passing technique and
                         mindset).

                    chapter 4.3.2 on the triangle pass), these passes most often

                         running position (rebound).

                    In today’s modern soccer, give-and-go passes and bouncing are frequently used in
                    motion sequences and allow the midfielders and wingbacks in particular to move and
                    turn more easily, confidently, and precisely on the turf.

                    This chosen terminology is intended to appeal to the players, especially on an
                    emotional level. Players (and coaches and instructors) grinning and delighting in the
                    choice of verbal images and borrowed metaphors in terms of knowledge and learning
                    is expressly desired (see chapters 1 and 3).

                    The following fig. 86 shows the simulated situation of a give-and-go pass (white/blue)
                    with subsequent rebound (bounce) (white/blue), one-touch triangle pass, and switch
                    pass (white/blue) in the opposing half, from the right halfback position to the left wing
                    (11er, white/blue). This scenario originates from the Brazil (here in white/blue) vs. the
                    Netherlands (here in red/white) game from July 2, 2010, at the South Africa World Cup,
                    with a 0-0 score (action sequence with times: 05:36 to 05:41 minutes playing time).

                    Fig. 87: Grid of five with rebound goals


                    Organization:
                    ■■ Mark five cone goals that are approximately 4 m wide.
                    ■■ The five cone goals are approximately 6 m apart.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ One player is positioned in each cone goal.
                    ■■ The player in the first cone goal plays the ball to the second player, who lets the
                         ball rebound, after which the first player plays the ball on to the third player, and
                         so on.
                    ■■ After the rebound the player must immediately turn and pass the ball.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Play the ball to the sides of the feet.
                    ■■ Get into the ready position (ball anticipation position).
                    ■■ Rebound without much rotation or spin on the ball.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Play only with the right foot.
                    ■■ Play only with the left foot.
                    ■■ The ball is only played high.

                    Organization: See fig. 87.

                    Progression:
                    See fig. 87 in which the players without a ball offer the passing player an angle,
                    meaning that they run to a cone, and the ball is passed to them from the left or right
                    halfback position.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Short run up to a cone.
                    ■■ “Eyes on the ball!”
                    ■■ Quick lateral steps; don’t crisscross (passing fitness).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The passing player can play the ball anywhere, and all players must make their
                         moves.
                    ■■ The passing player puts the ball in the middle of the goal, and the second player
                         should first feint to the outside and only after that quickly start back to the middle
                         (passing fitness).
                    ■■ No special running movements; the ball is rebounded (bounced) diagonally.

                    Organization: See fig. 87.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The passing player passes the ball to the second player, who lets it rebound.
                    ■■ The passing player continues to run through and plays the rebounded ball to the
                         third payer out of the forward movement, and so on.
                    ■■ When the passing player arrives at the last cone goal, he plays the ball back to the
                         second player, who has by now assumed the position of passing player.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The passing player cannot follow too quickly but instead must let the ball do its
                         work (timing) (passing technique).
                    ■■ “Always offer an angle!”
                    ■■ The ball should not bounce; first choice is ground passes!” (Passing technique)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Play with specific feet.
                    ■■ Bounce the ball back using the sole of the foot (passing technique).
                    ■■ Practice with two touches.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Mark a 30-x-40-m square.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ There is a player positioned at each cone (plus a supplementary player).
                    ■■ There are two extra players in the middle.
                    ■■ The passing player in the circle passes to the player closest to the ball in the center.
                         He lets the ball rebound to the second outside player. The outside player plays the
                         ball to the far player in the center who rebounds it to the third outside player, who
                         then lets the ball rebound to the near player in the center. This player lets the ball
                         rebound to the fourth outside player, and so on.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ If the ball is played too slowly, move toward the ball (passing mindset).
                    ■■ If the ball is played too fast, chill for a moment.
                    ■■ Always use ground passes (passing technique).

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Set up four cones on a field that is 40 x 15 m.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle plays a diagonal pass to the player opposite him and then
                         continues to run straight ahead. He receives the rebounded ball into his running
                         path, passes it again diagonally to the next player, and keeps running forward.
                         Then he receives a second rebounded pass into this running path. He then passes
                         this ball straight ahead to the fourth player who briefly stops the sequence and
                         then starts a new sequence (mirror reverse).

                    ■■ “Ask for the ball!”
                    ■■ “Fast pace!”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Practice with two mandatory touches (passing technique).
                    ■■ Deliberately pass and rebound the ball behind the teammate to briefly halt team
                         play (and be able to stand), much like a play-stop (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Combine the sequence with a transition to the finish: One large goal with goalie
                         off the marked field.
                    ■■ Synchronization: When the first player goes, the second player comes. When the
                         first player rebounds, the second player goes, and the third player comes (coming
                         and going in a group).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle passes the ball to the right wing player.
                    ■■ The wing player rebounds the ball to the center player, who then plays it into the
                         running path of the wing player (give-and-go passes).
                    ■■ The wing player passes/crosses the ball to the intersecting forwards or plays a hard
                         (back) ground pass to the central player who is moving up.
                    ■■ Change sides to start a new sequence.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Precise running action (intersecting, moving up) to clear passing lines (passing
                         tactics and technique).
                    ■■ The wing player must run between the lines.
                    ■■ To the rebounders: “Remember our motto: Play and go!”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The wing player plays a direct wall pass with the forward closer to the ball (passing
                         tactics).
                    ■■ The wing payer rebounds the ball to the passing player who turns to the other side
                         and rebounds the ball to the other wing player (passing technique).
                    ■■ The wing player passes the ball to a forward in the center who rebounds the ball to
                         the previous passing player who is farther away and who then makes an opening
                         pass to the other side to be played on the other wing (passing tactics).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ All players stand approximately in the center of one half of the playing field.
                    ■■ Three players form a triangle as central midfielders.
                    ■■ The player closest to the goal represents the center forward.

                    ■■ The central midfielders play direct triangle passes to each other.
                    ■■ The right central midfielder (6er) then plays a fake pass to the center forward (9er)
                         who lets the ball rebound to the top of the triangle to the 10er.
                    ■■ The 10er rebounds (in this case, opens) the ball to the right wing player, the 7er,
                         who lets the ball rebound to the diagonally forward-running 9er.

                    Coaching:

                    ■■ The 6er opens with a direct ball to the wing player who lets it rebound into the
                         center.
                    ■■ The 6er passes to the 9er. The 9er passes to the 10er who plays a switch pass to
                         the wing player. This player rebounds with the 9er, and the wing forward plays a
                         cross to the wing forward who is moving up and plays the finish.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ See fig. 94 in which a goal can only be scored if a forward is positioned in the end
                         zone and rebounds the ball.
                    ■■ A midfielder who is moving up takes a shot or plays the killer pass to the forward.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Players must offer angles everywhere (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Play incisive and quick passes (passing technique).
                    ■■ Players without the ball must ask for the ball (passing fitness).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The forward is allowed to score when he does a 1v1 offensive dribble.
                    ■■ Players can play unrestricted but must rebound in the end zones.
                    ■■ Narrow the playing field so the rebounding element (and the give-and-go passes)

                    4.3.12 THE WaLL Pass

                       “If World Player of the Year was an award for the most valuable player, meaning
                       not his market value, but the value of his inner stability, overall strength, the
                       magical togetherness of a team – then surely Ribéry would have been a better
                       choice than Ronaldo, soccer’s perfect scoring machine.”
                       (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jan. 1, 2014, No. 11, pg. 23)



                                                                                The wall pass is double the fun! Which
                                                                                soccer player isn’t familiar with this
                                                                                saying? It points to the basic element of
                                                                                team play, playing with a teammate.

                                                                                During a wall pass, a player is in
                                                                                possession and uses a wall player to have
                                                                                the ball returned to him. Thus the wall
                                                                                pass is a means for



                    ■■ quickly regaining possession and
                    ■■ quickly bridging a space.

                    In this context, the player in possession must pass the ball so that

                    ■■ the wall player can pass it into a space or
                    ■■ back to the passing player’s foot for the wall pass.

                    In a competitive game, it often happens that two players on a team doing a quick
                    passing combination outplay a player with a wall pass. For example, during the
                    2011/2012 Champions League season, 345 goals were scored, 29 of those with the
                    aid of the wall pass and the three-way combination from combination play. The wall
                    pass thus ranks fourth in the historical ranking of goals from open play (comparison:
                    39 goals from long shots; see UEFA 2012a, pg. 10).

                    If in this regard, training is supposed to also be effective for the success of (team)
                    play. The coaches and instructors must design drills and forms of play that show the
                    players running paths without the ball and also challenge the wall players to use only
                    one touch.

                    The following fig. 95 shows the simulated situation of a wall pass by Arsenal London
                    (red/white) on the left wing in their own half. The scene stems from the Arsenal
                    London (red/white) vs. FC Barcelona (white/blue) Champions League game on Feb.
                    16, 2011, with a 0-0 score (action sequence with times: 04:13 to 04:15 of playing
                    time).

                    The ascertained time of 3 sec for possession, switch pass, and renewed possession
                    shows how quickly a space can be bridged.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Five cones are set up slightly off-center in a line.
                    ■■ One player per cone (four total).
                    ■■ Freely choose the distances between cones based on skill level and training
                         objectives.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle plays the ball past the cone to the right or left foot of the
                         teammate standing behind the second cone.
                    ■■ He lets the ball rebound to the trailing player.
                    ■■ He passes the ball to the next teammate.
                    ■■ After the third wall pass to the players at the cones, the player settles the ball,
                         turns around the fifth cone, and again plays three wall passes on the other side.
                    ■■ The three wall players position so they can again let the ball rebound behind the
                         cones.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The player in the circle must configure his running paths so that he can change the
                         pace. In doing so he must make sure he doesn’t run too fast or too slow (passing
                         tactics).

                    ■■ The three wall players should be in the open position (passing technique).
                    ■■ Play the ball as an incisive ground pass into the player’s path (passing technique).
                    ■■ If possible, do not play the pass with the weak foot (passing technique).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The wall player plays with two touches.
                    ■■ The running player plays with two touches.
                    ■■ The running player plays only one wall pass sequence and then passes a long ball
                         directly to the first wall player. All other players move up to the next position.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle approaches with a dribble and plays the ball to the
                         teammate diagonally opposite him. As he begins his dribble, the player directly
                         across from him attacks.

                    ■■ This turns into a wall pass followed by settling the ball and another brief dribble
                         approach.
                    ■■ After that the player in possession makes a diagonal pass in the direction of the
                         wall player’s point of origin. But he can also forgo the pass and occupy the position
                         of the teammate directly opposite him.
                    ■■ The wall player and the defender look for another position.
                    ■■ A new sequence begins in front of the new cone.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Play hard passes (passing technique).
                    ■■ The wall player plays the ball into the path.
                    ■■ Don’t lose track of the situation during the fast dribble (passing intelligence).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The player in the circle makes a direct pass to the player diagonally opposite him.
                    ■■ The players play the double-wall pass, meaning the player in the circle executes
                         two actions.
                    ■■ The defending player tries to gain possession in the 2v1 situation and immediately
                         after winning the ball plays a wall pass with a player positioned at one of the
                         cones.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Visual perception should not only be deep but also wide. Use entire 180-degree
                          angle of vision (passing intelligence).
                    ■■ Wall players can also play the high wall pass (passing tactics).
                    ■■ All players should risk playing faulty wall passes (passing mindset).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Add two neutral players next to each of the two goals to ramp up the deep ball.
                    ■■ Mark the playing field longer and narrower.
                    ■■ Speed-wall passing: only 8 sec to the finish.


                    4.3.13 THE angLED Pass

                       “The elementary steps that define a good player are that he receives the ball,
                       passes.”
                       (Angel Cappa—Argentine coach)



                                                                    During an international game against the
                                                                    US, the German goalie Marc-André ter

                    For the purpose of practice and instruction, all passes, short or long, should have a
                    specific angle: angled pass, not square, as the following practice example illustrates.
                    The opponent can reach square passes more quickly. This makes the parallel position
                    of the two central defenders in a back four or double six in a 1-4-3-3 (point to the
                    front) to each other particularly difficult for continued effective play.

                    If the pass is tied to gaining space, the players without the ball play a central role.

                    ■■ Break away from the opponent. Example: Opponent is close to the offensive player,
                         so either push off from the opponent and immediately sprint toward him or in
                         another direction, or pull clear.
                    ■■ Get out of the cover shadow in the passing gaps (break away in the gaps).
                         Example: Offering a cover gap in which the players can then dribble after passing
                         and receiving the ball.
                    ■■ Offer support facing the game (open position) to be able to immediately pass
                         offensively or dribble towards the opponent. The open position is very important
                         especially at the sides of the field, on the wings, and during buildup. Motto: “In
                         behind into touch!”
                    ■■ If the ball is not in play, pre- and post-actions are critical requirements for effective
                         passing at an angle:
                          ■■ Starting motions into open space are typical pre-actions.
                          ■■ Running after one’s own pass or moving to a new space is a typical post-
                               action.
                    ■■ Create passing stations: left, right, gap, and advantageous angles for passing in a
                         rectangular space.

                    If the teammates without the ball behave appropriately for the situation, the angled
                    pass is an excellent means for gaining space simply and effectively because it can
                    only be defended with effort by the entire opposing team. Moreover, practicing and
                    teaching the angled pass is linked with perceiving and practicing the long pass.

                    The following fig. 102 shows the simulated situation of an angled pass by Atletico
                    Bilbao (white/blue) in the center of the field.

                    The 9er standing off-center (white/blue) moved out of the central defender’s cover
                    shadow (see first passing arrow) and stands in the gap for the angled pass. This is
                    also the case with the 6er (white/blue) (see second passing arrow). This results in
                    additional passing angles (see third passing arrow) that won’t be further elaborated
                    on here. This scene originates from the Atletico Bilbao (white/blue) vs. Atletico Madrid
                    (red/white) European League final on May 5, 2012, at a 0:0 score (action sequence
                    with times: 04:05 to 04:08—ball on the wing—playing time).

                    4.3.14 THE HEaD Pass

                       “Practice doesn’t make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect.”
                       (Franz Beckenbauer)




                    The following two situations often occur during competitive play:

                    1. An attacker is positioned at the back post during a set piece and heads the ball
                         to a teammate.
                    2. The goalie deflects the ball from the ground, and the midfielder in a 1v1 heads it
                         directly in front of the 10er’s feet as an assist.

                    Most often these two example game situations develop into well-thought out attacking
                    and finishing actions.

                    As described, the header is considered a head pass. It is, of course, different from a
                    pure offensive or defensive header. Accordingly, the head pass does not aim to score a
                    direct goal or to prevent a goal.

                    It goes without saying that the head pass must be learned and practiced during
                    training and instruction.

                    The following fig. 107 shows the simulated situations of a purposeful head pass by the
                    6er of Ajax Amsterdam (white/blue) to the left wingback (white/blue) in a common
                    1v1 situation in the center of the field. Seven other controlled and well-thought out

                    passing and dribbling actions developed from this and eventually led to a 2-0 win
                    against NEC Nijmegen. The scene stems from the March 31, 2013, game between Ajax
                    Amsterdam (white/blue) and NEC Nijmegen (red/white) in the Dutch soccer league,
                    at a 1-0 score (action sequence with times: 76:08 to 76:27 minutes of playing time).

                    The illustration shows the purposeful head pass to the rear in the direction of the left
                    defender who opens up, turns, dribbles, and then plays a chip pass on the wing to the
                    9er, who triggers additional automatisms until the finish. This is also supported by the
                    approximately 19 sec of playing time (relatively long) until the finish.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Two large goals (with goalies) are set up approximately 20 m apart.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Two head pass players can be chosen who must head the ball to their respective
                         center forward.
                    ■■ When two players attack, two players should immediately play as opposing
                         defensive players (2v2 situations plus goalie in the penalty box).
                    ■■ If the finish is unsuccessful immediately play at the other goal, the changeover.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Play the head pass incisively even with an opponent (passing mindset).
                    ■■ Do not play the head pass square but rather angled (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Ask for immediate changeover from offense to defense and vice versa (passing
                         philosophy). The goalie always actively participates in the game.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Head the ball directly to the goalie and then play 2v2.
                    ■■ Play a direct head pass at goal.
                    ■■ Play a head pass to the goalie and then immediately look for the 1v1 with the
                         opposing player.

                    ■■ Two neutral players are positioned next to each large goal.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Open play.
                    ■■ Two neutral players are positioned next to each of the two large goals and after a
                         head pass must head the ball back onto the field (head ball assist).

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The volley must be played hard and incisive (passing technique).

                    ■■ When playing the head pass, aim for the centers’ feet. Objective: To make receiving
                         the ball easy (passing technique and tactics).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The head pass can only be played to the player who passed the ball.
                    ■■ The head pass must be played to the third player.
                    ■■ A goal after a head pass counts as double. But the neutral players can now also

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Mark a zone in front of the goal that the ball must be headed into (passing
                         technique).
                    ■■ On the field the ball is headed only, and only the neutral players on the wing can
                         now also use foot passing techniques.
                    ■■ All players, including the goalie, can only play head passes (passing technique).

                    ■■ Goals can only be scored if a head pass was played as an assist.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ In addition to combinations, alternately play a quick switch pass to the teammate’s
                         head (passing intelligence).
                    ■■ “Push the head pass into the center or to the back post!” (Passing technique and

                         a flick on to the own 9er (passing intelligence or creativity).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ All players play with their heads.
                    ■■ Goal must be scored with a header.

                    4.3.15 THE THROW-in Pass

                       “If you want to become a champion you must play against champions.”
                       (Svetislav Pesic, Bayern Munich basketball coach, in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, January 17, 2014, No.

                       14, pg. 28)



                                                                               Because the throw-in pass is the only
                                                                               pass played by hand by a field player, it
                                                                               generally does not get much attention in
                                                                               soccer practice. A common perception is:
                                                                               “Anyone can do a throw-in! Both feet on
                                                                               the ground and hands and ball behind
                                                                               the head, and there you go.”

                                                                               However, it is still important to address
                                                                               some technical and tactical details that
                                                                               coaches and instructors should not miss
                                                                               and that speak for the relevant training of
                                                                               the throw-in pass.
                    ■■ The player making the throw-in is in possession (passing philosophy).
                    ■■ During a throw-in pass the opponent on the field has a superior number, which
                         seems trivial at this point, and the team in possession is outnumbered. Many
                         players are not aware of these facts at that moment.
                    ■■ Is the opponent organized or disorganized? The timing of the throw-in depends on
                         this decision, to throw in quickly or slowly (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Throw-in passes must be incisive (passing technique).
                    ■■ Nearly every throw-in pass is a waist-high ball for the teammates so that it first
                         must be received with technical precision (receiving technique).
                    ■■ Moreover long throw-in passes, particularly into the opposing danger zone can be
                         an effective means for generating scoring opportunities near the goal (see UEFA
                         2012a, pg. 10)

                    The following fig. 111 shows the simulated situation of a throw-in pass by Alves (FC
                    Barcelona) (red/white) to his teammate Messi (red/white) on their own right wing
                    in their half. Messi makes a direct volley pass (receiving the ball) at a run toward the
                    player making the throw-in and is thus double teamed by two players from Manchester
                    United (white/blue).

                    After the volley back-pass to Alves the FC Barcelona’s 6er, Busquets, moves up toward
                    the same and thereby forms a passing triangle in a 4v4 near the player making the
                    throw-in. Alves plays a give-and-go pass with Messi who lets the ball rebound to the
                    6er, who is moving up because the second Manchester United player has shifted from
                    Messi toward Alves. This suspended the double-teaming on the wing. Messi sees that
                    his 1v2 has become a 1v1, and after his triangle pass to Busquets, he runs at top
                    speed behind his opponent who is still moving forward. Busquets plays a flat pass into
                    Messi’s path, who gets behind Manchester’s back four into the open space to the goal.

                    This scene is from the FC Barcelona (red/white) vs. Manchester United (white/blue)
                    Champions League final in May, 2011, at a 0-0 score (action sequence with times:
                    08:46 to 08:52 minutes—ball is back with the 10er—of playing time).

                    The illustration shows the great importance of receiving the ball after a throw-in pass
                    and the previously mentioned tactical implications after the player making the throw-
                    in gets back on the field.

                    ■■ The player receiving the ball must first keep the ball in the air and then play it to

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The throw-in pass is directed at the head.
                    ■■ The throw-in pass should only be directed at the feet.
                    ■■ Add one large goal with goalie to practice the finish (passing mindset).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle throws the ball to the teammate in the center.
                    ■■ The coach or instructor directs: “Rebound the ball, play with the right foot, pass to
                         [a specific player]!”
                    ■■ After several actions, change positions.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Throw in even if the central player isn’t ready (element of surprise).
                    ■■ “Throw in without much spin!” (Passing technique)
                    ■■ Throw in from a short distance with lots of precision (passing mindset).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The four players forming the diamond all hold a ball. The central player decides
                         who will pass him the ball.
                    ■■ The central player executes 10 quick throw-in passes, and the four players in the
                         diamond must react with situational ball control (passing technique).
                    ■■ The central player plays a no-look pass to the next player in the diamond, who
                         must react immediately.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Four players play at a large goal with goalie on a playing field that is 25 x 25 m.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle throws the ball to the teammate who flicks the throw-in
                         pass on another player with his head or foot.
                    ■■ The player plays a direct switch pass to the fourth teammate.
                    ■■ This player catches the ball and immediately throws it to the second player
                         (attacker) who must play a 1v1 against the switch pass player (defender) who is
                         moving in.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Play quick sequences and progressions (passing fitness).
                    ■■ Short throw-in pass equals extreme precision, long throw-in pass equals power
                         (speed) (passing tactics and intelligence).
                    ■■ The player making the throw-in can also throw the ball into space to prompt the
                         player without the ball to actively gain space (passing mindset and philosophy).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Players do not play a 1v1, but rather play at the goal together as two forwards.
                    ■■ The attacker does not have to shoot directly at the goal because he gets the option
                         of shifting to a player making the throw-in (passing intelligence).
                    ■■ The player in the circle plays a short throw-in pass to his teammate, who lets the
                         ball rebound, followed by a long throw-in pass to the other teammate, who must
                         finish.

                    ■■ Once the ball has been played to the outside, the player immediately executes a
                         post-action and offers his support (passing fitness).
                    ■■ “Throw the ball to the foot or the head!”

                    ■■ The player throwing the ball can also throw it in the goal (passing mindset).

                    ■■ Open play.
                    ■■ During ongoing open play, the coach repeatedly calls for a throw-in pass.
                    ■■ Then a player near the ball must sprint toward the sidelines and execute the throw-
                         in pass.
                    ■■ The first ball is a timed pass toward a sideline and then is available again for a

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The player throwing the ball must identify the team’s tactical situation and choose
                         the most effective way of executing the throw-in pass (passing intelligence and
                         tactics).

                    ■■ Motto: “When the opponent is organized, the short (and incisive) throw-in pass is
                         the best choice for keeping possession!” (Passing tactics)

                    Variations:

                         makes a throw-in pass from the wing position.
                    ■■ The player at the right sideline can only throw short, and the other player can only
                         throw long.
                    ■■ The teams must react to these two versions.

                    4.3.16 Passing inTO sPaCE

                       “How often do you see a pass of more than 40 meters when 20 meters is enough?
                       Or a one-two in the penalty area when there are seven people around you when a
                       simple wide pass around the seven would be the solution?”
                       (Johan Cruijff, 2007)




                    Everyone is familiar with a situation that often occurs during practice or a competition:
                    The ball is played into a certain space and no teammate takes up the offer, so the ball
                    goes to the opponent without a fight. The spectators whistle and incomprehension
                    and uncertainty can spread through the team.

                    Many players are not ready or prepared for a pass into open space without prior verbal
                    or non-verbal communication with the recipient—or an automated and unimpeded
                    combination.

                    But the pass into open space can be an essential element of a creative tactical action:

                    ■■ The players do not always pass the ball to a specific recipient (element of surprise).
                    ■■ The pass into a certain space must be played courageously (willingness to take
                         risks).
                    ■■ The teammate without the ball is prompted to run into space (stimulative nature).

                                                        THE Passing gaME is a PREREQUisiTE FOR gOOD sOCCER




                    ■■ In today’s soccer, passes into the seams, vertical passes, and up-and-over passes
                         into spaces are considered essential characteristics of highly creative and successful
                         players (see Memmert 2013d).
                    ■■ The pass is played purposefully into a space in which the opposing team is already
                         located. The opponent takes possession and is immediately put under pressure
                         in the space by the other team’s counterattack (see chapter 4.5). Pep Guardiola
                         says the following: “When you attack with the ball the opponent is in defensive
                         formation. Give him the ball, and they all run forward. When you then take the ball
                         away from the opponent, by the time they have all turned around you are right in
                         front of their goal. But you have to be very tight to get the ball right back after the
                         turnover” (quote from Schulze-Marmeling 2013, pg. 185).
                    ■■ In some game situations the player on the ball can be perplexed and helpless. At
                         such a point a pass into space can help him solve his problem independently, even
                         if at first glance this method appears to be ineffective (Schulze-Marmeling 2013,
                         pg. 185).

                    The following fig. 118 shows the simulated situation of a (one-touch) pass into space
                    by Ribéry (FC Bayern Munich) (red/white) to his teammate Müller (red/white). Kroos
                    initiates this combination from the center of the field with a switch pass played with
                    the outside of the foot to Ribéry in the opposing half. He is in a position on the
                    left wing and plays a long pass into space with one touch into the seam between
                    wingback and central defender (white/blue). After a pre-action, Müller sprints (in an
                    arc) between the two central defenders (white/blue) into this pass into the seam.

                    This scene stems from the Champions League game on Oct. 2, 2013, between
                    Manchester City (white/blue) and FC Bayern Munich (red/white) at a 0-0 score
                    (action sequence with times: 08:46 to 08:52 minutes—ball in space behind back four—
                    of playing time.

                    ■■ The player in the circle passes the ball diagonally into space.
                    ■■ The player diagonally opposite him tries to chase down the ball. He starts only
                         after the ball has been played. The pass into space is timed so that the player can
                         reach it in time.
                    ■■ The player lets the ball rebound into the short, open space to the player opposite
                         him, who plays a long pass into space to the player in the back.
                    ■■ Both players switch positions and thereby carry out pre- and post-actions.
                    ■■ The passing combination is then smoothly transitioned and continued on the other
                         side.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The player must react quickly to the ball (passing fitness).
                    ■■ The players must keep a constant eye on their spaces (passing intelligence).
                    ■■ “Follow the ball with your eyes!”

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Increase distances.
                    ■■ Frequently play a wall pass to the teammate’s foot (passing intelligence).
                    ■■ Set up a second grid of four via mirroring. The grids of four can be left or switched
                         with a switch pass in the sense of shifting play (passing tactics).

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 6v6 at two large goals with goalies on a playing field that is 50 x 40 m.
                    ■■ A zone 20 m wide is marked off with cones in the center of the field.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The players can sprint into the end zones (dark areas) only after the ball has been
                         played (passing tactics).
                    ■■ The teammate on the ball forces the player without the ball to start into space
                         (passing mindset).
                    ■■ The defenders also cannot run into the end zones before the pass into space has
                         been played.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Ask for lots of flat passes through the seams (passing intelligence).
                    ■■ The ball should be played in such a way that it can be accompanied.
                    ■■ When the opponent receives the ball, the team immediately switches to a counter
                         press. Motto: “We can score even when the opponent has the ball!” (Passing tactics)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Increase or decrease field measurements.
                    ■■ 7v5: The outnumbered team can also pass the ball to the foot. This is meant
                         to tempt (i.e., challenge) the superior numbers team into pressing (passing
                         philosophy).
                    ■■ After accompanying the ball, either a shot at goal must be taken or a 1v1 must be
                         sought (passing mindset).




                    Fig. 121: Variation: Accompanying the ball with chip balls


                    Organization:
                    ■■ 8v8 at two large goals with goalies on one half of a large playing field.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ See fig. 120 in which the balls must now be chipped (passing technique).
                    ■■ Keep looking for the wings, especially when all the opposing players’ efforts
                         are ball-oriented, and they are focusing on the ball (passing philosophy and
                         intelligence).

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The ball must be chipped from the center of the middle zone.
                    ■■ Choose an alternative: Play a switch pass into open space (passing intelligence).

                    ■■ “Rule: Start running after the ball has been played because the attacker always has
                         the advantage!” (Passing tactics and philosophy)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The players can hold the ball in their hands and play it into space as a volley pass
                         (surprise element).
                    ■■ Play on three-quarters of a large field to initiate longer passes into space (passing
                         technique).
                    ■■ The player without a ball decides when the ball is passed into space. The chief
                         without a ball blasts off into a certain space and receives the ball there (passing
                         technique and philosophy).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Open play in which goals can also be scored.
                    ■■ Additional option: The ball can be passed or chipped behind the goal, and the
                         attacker can pass the ball into the field with a back pass with the intent of scoring
                         a subsequent goal.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Pay attention to timing of the pass into space!” (Passing technique and tactics)
                    ■■ Forward must react quickly (passing fitness).
                    ■■ Accompany the pass into space (passing tactics)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ If the attacker reaches the ball before the defender does, the attacker gets a bonus
                         point (passing mindset).
                    ■■ If the ball is played into the back zone all players must move across a centerline to
                         be marked off in order to immediately execute a counter-press with a tight net in
                         the event of a turnover (passing philosophy and mindset).
                    ■■ If a goal is scored with a header after an assist or a second to last ball from the
                         back zone, it counts as triple (passing intelligence).

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 11v11 from penalty area to penalty area at two large goals with goalies.
                    ■■ Divide and mark off the playing field into eight lateral zones.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The ball can only be played for 4 to 6 sec (depending on skill and training level)
                         in one zone.
                    ■■ The ball must quickly alternate between width and depth.
                    ■■ In doing so the player on the ball is the chief on the ball.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Ask for deep flat passes (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Practice chip balls on the wings.

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Decrease the size of the playing field and ask for flat passes only (passing
                         technique).
                    ■■ The ball can bridge the space between the defensive and offensive zone only with
                         a long pass.
                    ■■ Mark an end zone in front of the opposing goal and frequently pass the ball into
                         this space (promoting willingness to take risks). If the attacker is in possession he
                         can play the 1v1 against the goalie by himself (passing mindset and fitness).


                    4.3.17 THE OnE-TOUCH Pass

                       “When we are at our maximum and we’re playing our quick passing game, it’s
                       outstanding. It’s one-touch football and it destroys the opposition. Today in
                       training we played four against four and everyone touched the ball in six seconds.
                       One touch, one pass, cut it back and score.”
                       (Robin van Persie, formerly of FC Arsenal London, presently Manchester United)



                                                                              In today’s soccer everyone talks about
                                                                              one-touch passing: playing with just one

                                                                              Often the ball is passed from one

                    ■■ The pre-actions that are essentially responsible for the success of a situational one-
                         touch pass (open and closed position relative to the ball).
                    ■■ The option of passing to the third man.
                    ■■ Letting the ball rebound to the passing player.
                    ■■ Can the player open the game with one touch or does the one-touch pass contribute
                         to purposive possession?
                    ■■ If the field is very small (tight), it is important to be able to break away. At such a
                         time a one-touch pass would be a time and stress regulator because it would help,
                         for instance, to promptly shift to another space without losing possession.

                    The following fig. 124 shows the simulated situation of a one-touch pass into the
                    seam by an Atletico Madrid midfielder (white/blue) from a half-open position (after
                    a previous give-and-go pass with the left central defender and subsequent pre-action)
                    to the left winger running into space. This player crosses the ball in behind the defense
                    and to the advancing 9er.

                    The scene is from the European League final on May 9, 2012, between Atletico Bilbao
                    (red/white) and Atletico Madrid (white/blue) at a 0-0-score (action sequence with
                    times: 01:36 to 01:42 minutes—cross to the 9er near the goal—of play).

                    The illustration exemplarily shows several characteristics outlined at the beginning:
                    The outnumbered 2v3 situation (for the attacker on the wing; small field) until the
                    cross can be resolved effectively with a long (dosed) and quick one-touch pass within
                    6 sec.


                    EXAMPLES FOR TRAINING AND PRACTICE




                    Fig. 125a: One-touch in squares


                    Organization:
                    ■■ In a 30-x-30-m square, mark off an additional 15-x-15-m square.
                    ■■ Each square is manned with eight players (two players at each cone).
                    ■■ The players facing each other form a group: red with red, blue with blue, etc. Each
                         group has a ball.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ In both squares, players pass each other the ball diagonally and flat. One-touch is

                    ■■ The passing players chase after their ball.
                    ■■ If the position changes get too hectic, the players in the outer square can, if
                         needed, receive and control the balls to the side and only then pass.
                    ■■ The players in the inner circle switch with those in the outer circle as specified by
                         the coach or instructor (time limits depending on training goal and skill level).

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Keep your eyes open and always keep moving!” (Passing fitness)
                    ■■ Coach each other with designated code words (passing philosophy).
                    ■■ Time the passes and running paths; put feeling into the ball because there are up
                         to three opposing balls in play (passing technique and mindset).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Allow one to two touches. Pay attention to situational context (passing intelligence).
                    ■■ Ask for both feet to be used (passing technique).
                    ■■ Add different types of balls (large or small, heavy or light) (passing technique).
                    ■■ Add mini goals and have lots of replacement balls on hand.

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 8v8 in a 40-x-40-m square.
                    ■■ A mini goal is set up on each of the square’s sidelines.
                    ■■ An 8-m taboo zone is marked off in front of each mini goal.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ One-touch passes.
                    ■■ Each team defends two diagonally adjacent goals.
                    ■■ Goals must be scored direct from outside the zones.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Incisive passing (passing technique).
                    ■■ Precept: The passing player always becomes the pass recipient (passing fitness).
                    ■■ “Courage for the risky touch!” (Passing mindset).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Mark mini goals with colored bibs or cones and change the direction of play at
                         the coach’s or instructor’s command (“Team red to yellow!”) (Passing intelligence).

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 9v9 on one half of a field at two large goals with goalies.
                    ■■ A total of four 7-x-7-m one-touch zones are marked off on this field, and the two
                         central zones are called offensive zones.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Open play in a specific tactical formation.
                    ■■ If the ball is played into a one-touch zone, it can only be played with one touch in
                         this zone as well.
                    ■■ The defending team cannot attack in the one-touch zone.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ During buildup choose a confident and incisive passing game out of the one-touch
                         zone (passing technique).
                    ■■ Fire and risk-taking in the offensive one-touch zones (passing mindset).
                    ■■ The passing player immediately becomes the pass receiver (passing fitness).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Decrease or increase the size of one-touch zones.
                    ■■ One-touch only in the center: 8v8 at two large goals with goalies on two-thirds of
                         a large playing field. Mark off a middle zone 25 x 30 m wide from penalty area to
                         penalty area. Direct play is mandatory in the middle zone.
                    ■■ Coach’s darlings: Only two to three players are allowed to play one-touch passes.
                         The coach or instructor picks the players.
                    ■■ The emotional rollercoaster: 1 minute of open play and 1 minute of one-touch
                         soccer.

                    Fig. 127: Grid of six: Buildup with one-touch passes


                    Organization:
                    ■■ At least one player is positioned at each cone in a grid of six.
                    ■■ The position of the player in the circle must be manned multiple times.
                    ■■ Distances between cones depend on the respective training goal.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player in the circle dribbles. In a competitive game, he is number 4/5. He
                         plays a diagonal pass (skip a row) to one of the players positioned at the sides, in
                         a competitive game positions 2 and 8 (left side) or positions 3 and 7.
                    ■■ This player lets the ball rebound to the skipped player 2/3.
                    ■■ The central 6er anticipates this double action early on and readies to receive a
                         pass. He receives the one-touch pass from 2/3 and lets it rebound to 7/8.
                    ■■ The 6er receives the return wall pass and does a fast dribble to the starting point
                         of the one-touch combination.
                    ■■ Every passing player moves up one position.
                    ■■ Switch sides.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Quick and incisive one-touch passing game (passing technique).
                    ■■ Pass next to the body in the direction of the outside foot (also for the purpose of
                         controlling the ball).
                    ■■ Execute running feints.
                    ■■ Control the ball from an open position.
                    ■■ Change pace and direction (passing fitness).
                    ■■ Keep up intensive communication—verbal and non-verbal (passing mindset).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Simultaneous combinations to both sides (increase number of players and balls).
                    ■■ Set up two mini goals next to the starting point for combinations. These must be
                         a. played at directly with a penetrating pass after the wall pass (use both feet), or
                         b. passed at quickly and incisively from a fast dribble.
                    ■■ Set up a mini goal at the imaginary 10er or 9er position and a penetrating pass
                         from the 6er into the mini goal.
                    ■■ Same setup but use several mini goals in different playing directions (positions 7,
                         9, 11, and 9/10, etc.)

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 8 (white/blue) against 5 (red/white) on a marked off first playing field.
                    ■■ Three outnumbered players (red/white) position on a second adjoining field of the
                         same size (the angle distorts the two equally large fields).
                    ■■ Keep one ball and replacement balls handy at the edge of the field.
                    ■■ Choose field sizes based on skill level and training goal. For example, U19: from
                         the 18-yd box (with external dimensions) to the centerline (first field), and from the
                         centerline to the second 18-yd box (second field).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The superior numbers team plays for possession with one-touch passes.
                    ■■ After gaining possession, the outnumbered team should switch with a pass (e.g.,
                         switch pass) to the other field with the three teammates as quickly as possible.
                    ■■ The outnumbered team has open play.
                    ■■ Moving up after switching fields creates a new 8v5.
                    ■■ Three of the players on the team that lost the ball on the first field remain on their
                         field

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Stagger yourselves!” The three outnumbered players position on their field so that
                         a deep ball can be played when their five teammates on the opposing field gain
                         possession and the trailing players have open space to purposefully move up (e.g.,
                         circling up and positioning two central players for possession play with one-touch
                         passes) (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Ask outnumbered players to actively block spaces; control the direction of passes;
                         put pressure on the ball (the player near the ball runs toward the opposing player);
                         put pressure on the space (the teammate plays behind the pressing player, blocks
                         the passing lane, and controls the opponent’s game); and carry out feigned attacks.
                    ■■ “Do not run blindly toward the ball! Observe, communicate, take up your defensive
                         positions!”




                                                                                                          255

                    ■■ Decrease or increase the size of the playing fields (passing fitness).
                    ■■ Limit to one to two touches: If a superior numbers player requires two touches for
                         an error-free pass, he can do so. But subsequently his teammate must make do
                         with one touch. Motto: “Avoid a turnover!” (Passing tactics and intelligence)

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 2 x 4 against 3 at one goal with goalie on one-quarter of a large playing field.

                         themselves as follows:
                         a. Blue/white as part of a 1-4-3-3 with forward point or 1-4-2-3-1 (here the 6 has
                             possession, 10, 9 and 7)
                         b. Red/white with a central defender, a 2 and a 6

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The 6er briefly dribbles; the 10er runs (takes) off to create space.
                    ■■ The 6er passes to the 9er who is briefly offering support. He lets the ball rebound
                         to the 10er who makes a direct pass to the wing.
                    ■■ The 8er immediately plays a wall pass back to the 10er who immediately sends the
                         9er into the lane and the finish.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Play up-and-over with the first pass to quickly gain space (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Page 263
                    ■■ The wall pass to the wing is meant to lure the opponent to the outside, creating
                         passing gaps (passing tactics).
                    ■■ The 9er quickly turns, power, and goal (passing tactics and mindset).

                    ■■ Version B: The 6er passes to the winger (7); at the same time the 9er briefly offers
                         his support to the outside to open up the space for the 10er. The 7er immediately
                         plays the ball hard into the path of the 10er who takes it straight to the finish.
                    ■■ Version C (without illustration): As in Version B, at the end the 10er can play a pass
                         to the 9er cutting across. The reason: A second central defender possibly blocks
                         the space for the 9er as part of a tactical team measure or a second forward offers
                         himself for a wall pass. Motto: Learn about tactical group solutions.




                    Version D of fig. 129: Tactical group sequences to create scoring opportunities using one-touch passes


                    ■■ Version D: As in Version B, the 7er sprints after a running feint on the wing, the
                         10er again opens up the passing lane forward with an arced run, and the 6er in
                         possession plays a through ball to the approaching 9er. He lets the ball rebound in
                         with one touch to the quickly approaching 7er. If possible this player moves to the
                         inside and plays a quick and incisive pass to the trailing 10er (back post) and 9er
                         (penalty spot) for the finish. Motto: “Don’t give the opponent time for organized

                    Organization:
                    ■■ 2 x 3 against 2, constantly alternating.
                    ■■ Two adjoining playing fields.
                    ■■ Field sizes are based on skill level and training goal.
                    ■■ Many balls at the edge of the field.
                    ■■ Playing time is based on skill level and training goal (e.g., Bundesliga: approximately
                         30 sec. at highest intensity).

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Three defenders per playing field and two defenders at the center starting cone.
                    ■■ The coach or instructor plays a ball onto the respective field at the start and when
                         a ball goes out of play.
                    ■■ Direct play for the superior numbers team.
                    ■■ After a minimum of three passes, the superior numbers players can play the ball
                         onto the neighboring field.

                    ■■ When changing fields, the appropriate players immediately sprint onto the field
                         from the outside and the other pair leaves the field in the direction of the cone.

                    Coaching (outnumbered team):
                    ■■ “Keep your head up and constantly be in a ready position.” (Passing mindset)
                    ■■ “Incisive one-touch passing!” (Passing technique)
                    ■■ Get in open positions and choose the triangle as a safe organizational form
                         (passing tactics).
                    ■■ “Keep the space large!” (Passing tactics)
                    ■■ “Make quick decisions!”
                    ■■ Ask for communication and motivation (passing mindset).
                    ■■ The coach or instructor awards bonus points to players when they absolutely want
                         to keep possession during imprecise passing actions—in other words, facilitate ball
                         salvage actions in the sense of securing and helping (passing mindset).
                    ■■ “Close to the man? No problem! Play the pass forcefully, and make sure your
                         physical play is fair!” (Passing mindset)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Decrease or increase field sizes.
                    ■■ Increase the number of players.
                    ■■ Change the playing time.
                    ■■ Mark off a 2-m corridor between the two fields. The outnumbered team is allowed
                         to play there (making pressing more difficult).
                    ■■ Back pass only to teammates when the ball relay gets too long (highest level).
                    ■■ Competitions: See who can keep possession longest, and issue bonus points for
                         every interval and every ball salvage action. Make a chart to keep track of “the
                         one-touch heroes.”

                                                                         Gaal, and Guus Hiddink (see M. Meijers

                    Because today’s modern soccer is characterized significantly by fitness and dynamics,
                    today’s Tiqui-Taca might just be the answer: Positional play (with constantly changing
                    positions and large running paths) is combined with possession play that provides
                    the following important functions with constant attempts to get open, short passes,
                    and triangle passes:

                    ■■ To cause the opponent to abandon his safe, staggered positional play and fall
                         back on 1v1. This creates open space for the teammates.

                    ■■ To force the opponent to shift by constantly passing on the ball so that holes
                         opening up in the opponent’s ranks can be exploited for the killer passing game.
                    ■■ The team in possession compresses in a certain space, creates superior number
                         situations, and is able to create and quickly man spaces with quick and two-footed
                         short-pass combination play, especially in front of the opposing goal.
                    ■■ The team plays a possession game and patiently waits for an expedient game
                         situation, avoiding rashness, actionism, and high risk (controlling the game). This
                         behavior can be very important for midfield play.
                    ■■ Sometimes teams use the short pass game after very running-intensive game
                         phases (controlling the space) as a means for active regeneration. For instance,
                         if the team was able to quickly regain possession using counterattacking with a
                         high line after a turnover, it is most often followed by dosed short passes (and a
                         decrease in the overall playing speed) and resumed planned positions and a safe
                         attack strategy.

                    At the highest playing level, Tiqui-Taca therefore requires an exceptional fitness level
                    and athleticism, above average tactical intelligence and creativity, and unimpeded
                    and variably available passing techniques.

                    The Rondo is a form of play that echoes the essential functions of an effective Tiqui-
                    Taca as mentioned and can be used to train players in an often fun way. We outline
                    the top ten Rondos with specific focus areas. These have particular connections to the
                    playing philosophies of FC Barcelona under Pep Guardiola and Ajax Amsterdam under
                    Frank de Poer.

                    The most important technical characteristics of the Rondos can be summarized as
                    follows:

                    ■■ Short passes to the foot and into the path
                    ■■ Short passes without spin or rotation
                    ■■ Short pass combinations as a way to take the initiative in competitive play
                    ■■ “Exude dominance through technical perfection” (see Karlheinz Wild in kicker, Oct.
                         7, 2013, pg. 19)



                                                                                                       263

                    ■■ Small-scale quick pre- and post-actions
                    ■■ Two-footed one-touch combinations
                    ■■ Look for holes to pass into (gaps) as a prerequisite for unimpeded incisive short
                         passes
                    ■■ Change initial conditions: position changes

                    We prefer the 8v2/9v3 Rondos in a round or square, or rather rectangular space.
                    When the Rondo is played in a square or rectangular form, each player is able to
                    occupy positions that correspond to the team’s own formation. If a circular form is
                    chosen the relationship between space and time always remains the same.

                    An 8v2 Rondo gives the players who are trying to get possession the opportunity to
                    test an agreed upon defensive behavior (ball-oriented play, safeguarding each other,
                    offset in depth, situational double-teaming).

                    The 9v3 includes elements such as defensive triangles, hooks, shifting and makes the
                    long forward pass in particular more difficult. The superior numbers in the circle and
                    square or rectangle must learn to adapt to this with Tiqui-Taca. In summary it can be
                    said that during a turnover the Rondo with its many versions, different time intervals,
                    field sizes, and rules can be an important tool for the planning and implementation of
                    modern soccer practice and instruction.


                       “Improve your technical and tactical area!”


                    The following fig. 131 shows the simulated situation with Tiqui-Taca in the game
                    between FC Barcelona (red/white) against Real Madrid (white/blue) on Jan. 25,
                    2012, in the Primera Division. FC Barcelona’s 11 passing combinations in Real Madrid’s
                    defensive half highlight the great and game-effective importance of Tiqui-Taca in the
                    context of the previously mentioned functions: 16 sec. possession with killer pass and
                    the subsequent 1-0 FC Barcelona (action sequence with times 34:09 to 34:25 minutes
                    of play).

                    The distances between players in all of the subsequent Rondos should be determined
                    by group based on skill level and the main focus of training.


                         Rondo 1 with emphasis on receiving and passing


                    Progression:
                    ■■ Rule 1: Limit to one to two touches.
                    ■■ Rule 2: Immediately change positions after a turnover, play up to a certain number
                         of turnovers and then switch tasks, or run out the clock.
                    ■■ Rule 3: Switching the playing foot (left, right) is mandatory.
                    ■■ Alternate rule 3: Use the same playing foot twice.
                    ■■ Another alternative to rule 3: Three mandatory touches, and the playing foot can
                         be chosen freely.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Ball control.
                    ■■ Push pass (passing technique).
                    ■■ Make quick decisions.
                    ■■ Take the defenders’ positions into account.


                         Rondo 2 with emphasis on push passes over short distances (see fig. 132)


                    Progression:
                    ■■ Pass to the player’s strong foot.
                    ■■ See progression, Rondo 1

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Body should be over the ball!”
                    ■■ “Keep the ball flat!” (Passing technique)
                    ■■ “Stay on the ground and watch your supporting foot because it must be in a game-

                    ■■ See progression, Rondo 1

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Make the right decision!”
                    ■■ Choose the ball speed so the defender is spatially and temporally too late (passing
                         tactics).


                         Rondo 4 with emphasis on open space and then the long pass (see fig. 132)

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Rules for the long pass:
                         a. Defenders stay in the middle when a long pass has been played between two
                             defenders.
                         b. Defenders stay in the middle when the ball has been played through the center
                             two to three times.
                         c. Defenders stay in the middle when the ball has been passed on for one whole
                             round.
                         d. Defenders stay in the middle when the ball has been passed in the Rondo six
                             to eight times without turnover.
                         e. Defenders stay in the middle and now practice b and c together (passing
                             intelligence).
                    ■■ Motto: “Lots of space and time for our attacking game!” (Passing philosophy)

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Alternate between short and long passes (passing technique).
                    ■■ “Skip a line!”

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ “Look around and coach each other!”
                    ■■ Use the ball speed as a means of communication.
                    ■■ Pay attention to geometry: Long balls keep the defenders from stepping in because
                         the longer distances require them to run more (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Two touches mean: Control the Rondo with the first touch.
                    ■■ “If you use a hard pass it means: You don’t have time!”

                    ■■ The ball stays in motion, so the defenders cannot rest (passing fitness).
                    ■■ Slow ball as bait: The defender approaches and then a long pass follows (passing
                         tactics).

                         Rondo 8 with emphasis on changeover


                    Progression:
                    ■■ Rule 1: With possession, both or all three outnumbered players must try to get the
                         ball followed by player exchange.
                    ■■ Rule 2: The outnumbered players kick the ball out of play and move up, and the
                         superior numbers players try to immediately win back the ball.
                    ■■ Rule 3: See rule 2 with a marked-off field is set up for the Rondo (field size based
                         on skill level). On this field the outnumbered players, when in possession, must

                         pass the ball incisively and move up. This field must be taken over by the superior
                         numbers players by regaining possession.
                    ■■ Rule 4: If a superior numbers player loses the ball, he immediately becomes a
                         defender. The outnumbered player who won the ball immediately becomes an
                         attacker.
                    ■■ Rule 5: After a turnover the coach or instructor immediately sends a player back
                         into the center. Reason: to keep the game fast.
                    ■■ Rule 6: After a turnover, the coach or instructor quickly passes a new ball into the
                         game.
                    ■■ Rule 7: Whenever the superior number loses the ball, the player who made the bad
                         pass only switches positions with another player from the superior number on the
                         outside (position changes).

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Quick changeover in both directions: Offense to defense and defense to offense
                         (passing fitness, tactics, and intelligence).

                    ■■ One-touch passes in the Rondo.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Outnumbered players with 100% readiness for action.
                    ■■ Superior numbers players: “Look around and coach each other!”
                    ■■ See who can make the most passes in a determined amount of time. Competition:

                    Coaching:

                         assistant ref.
                    ■■ Now the players ref each other (passing mindset).

                         regular flow of the Rondo, a fun atmosphere, and his own decisions.

                    A fake pass is a part of other movement combinations and body feints. Some players
                    seem to have boundless creativity and intelligence; the transitions between individual
                    techniques are fluid, even those of the fake pass, which coaches or instructors can read
                    more and more often on the field.

                    A fake pass is a type of deceptive motion indicating a pass that the player does not
                    actually execute. It is like a passing technique in its origin. Players often use it to try to
                    get the defenders to change their position relative to the ball in order to get closer to
                    the goal with a pass, shot, or by dribbling.

                    Often the transitions between techniques cannot be clearly separated, occasionally
                    not even properly characterized, because situations change so quickly. Physical play
                    occurs during tackles, and the tactical creativity of defenders and attackers creates
                    unforeseen events in the course of the game.

                    The fake pass can therefore usually be seen in three (mixed) forms:

                    1. The “classic” fake pass, which is most often initiated from a delayed dribble. It
                         is followed by squaring the upper body, like for a flat pass, facing forward. The
                         pass is played, but the ball is not touched. Afterward, the ball is often cut back
                         with a quick turning movement, and the player vigorously dribbles away from the
                         opponent into the open space (e.g., Mario Götze, FC Bayern Munich).
                    2. Video analyses clearly show that after a fake with one foot a one-touch pass with
                         the other foot, for example, immediately follows (see the following scene from a
                         game). Combining dribbling and feints and passing are the focus of the game
                         situation.
                    3. The shot-at-goal feint also often originates with a dribble. The player fakes a shot
                         at goal with a distinct swinging motion of his dribbling leg and with the position of
                         his upper body and arms (see chapter 4.3.7). This is usually followed by controlling
                         the ball with the outside of the playing foot in the intended direction and the start
                         of a dribble.

                    The movement dynamics, the change of pace, the timing, the possible alternative
                    actions, and the unimpeded interconnected movements in a game situation or context
                    are the critical parameters for using a passing feint. Possible alternative actions are
                    therefore the particular focus of coaching:

                    ■■ Slow opponent: keep the pace, break through, and finish.
                    ■■ Fast opponent: Vigorous break-through on the other side against the defender’s
                         running path.
                    ■■ Opponent is too close: Turn inward or outward and stand; otherwise carry the ball
                         to the side or diagonally back, then safely open up again.
                    ■■ If, for instance, the opponent is prompted to move by an oblique dribble he will
                         most likely be forced into a (premature) decision.

                    In addition, the personality aspect—the player’s Passing Puzzle mindset during the
                    execution of feints in general—should be particularly emphasized at this time. Feints
                    require a passion for detail, courage, tenacity, self-motivation, goal-orientation, and a
                    sense of responsibility toward the action plan of teammates, coach, and club. The 1v1
                    situations in particular require playing at top speed while controlling the ball (in the
                    tightest spaces) and thus require the player to have the attitude of wanting to play at
                    the highest risk level, not only from a mental but also from a physical point of view
                    (training management, metering of mental and physical stress).

                    In practice, this means that mistakes are unavoidable. To get the best from a player
                    presupposes learning situations that require and help facilitate these key attributes
                    for competitive soccer. If emphasis is placed here during training and instruction, the
                    players are sensitized almost inevitably to this area of character building with the
                    appropriate guidance within the team (see chapter 1, 2, and 3). Coaches or instructors
                    in professional soccer training should not neglect encouraging the willingness to take
                    risks.

                    The following examples for practice and instruction can only become game effective

                    The following fig. 134 shows the simulated situation of a fake pass from an Ajax
                    Amsterdam player (white/blue) being confronted by the NEC Nijmegen winger (red/
                    white) moving in and subsequently slows down his dribble, suggests a feint to the
                    inside in the direction of the danger zone, but then makes a timed pass into the
                    path of the trailing 10er and into the open space. This deception results in the 2-0
                    win against Nijmegen. This scene comes from the Dutch soccer league game from
                    March 31, 2013, between Ajax Amsterdam and NEC Nijmegen at a 1-0 score (action
                    sequence with times: 76:17 to 76:24 minutes of play.

                    EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE AND INSTRUCTION




                                                                        Fig. 135: Passing fakes and feints in a gird of

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Six players on a 40-x-10-m practice field.
                    ■■ The practice field is divided into five equal areas and marked off with 10 cones
                         (grid of 10). This creates a stripe pattern.
                    ■■ A large goal with a goalie is positioned at a distance of approximately 16 m
                         behind the end of the fifth stripe.
                    ■■ The first and fifth players have possession. Additional balls are kept in reserve at
                         the sides of the stripes.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The players are lined up behind one another.
                    ■■ The third player does a pre-action to the side and gets a pass from the player at the
                         first line (starting action by playing across the line).
                    ■■ The player squares up and passes the ball to the fourth player and then chases
                         his pass.



                                                                                                                 275

                    ■■ The first and second line players simultaneously move up one line.
                    ■■ The fourth player carries the ball forward (change in playing direction) and feints
                         (including fake pass) and dribbles around the third, second, and first line players
                         who have moved up.
                    ■■ Meanwhile the fifth player plays a pass into the path of the third player. That
                         player feints and dribbles around him and immediately finishes with a one-touch
                         shot at the large goal with goalie with his non-dribbling foot.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The third (middle) player decides to which side he will carry out the pre-action
                         (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Focus on playing with both feet.
                    ■■ Focus on head control and keeping (passing technique).
                    ■■ Depending on the skill level, add easements (passive, partially active) or
                         complications (additional player moves to the outside, back, or side for 1v2)
                         (passing mindset).
                    ■■ Hold competitions with bonus points and ranking lists (passing mindset).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ The player on the second line actively defends the pass to the third player.
                    ■■ Feints with the ball with double stripe: Two adjacent stripes (18 cones, two large
                         goals with goalies, minimum of 12 players). The two players on the first line
                         play diagonal passes to the third line players (in each of the other stripes). They
                         receive and carry the ball and carry out a dribble with feints (including fake pass)
                         and body feints against each other. The second line players moving up generate
                         counter-pressure at the sides, keeping heads high and doing cut-backs. After that,
                         the progression is the same as an Ajax stripe (passing fitness and mindset).

                    Fig. 136: Passing fakes and feints with shot at goal under spatial and counter-pressure


                    Organization:
                    ■■ Set up two goals with goalies 35 m apart.
                    ■■ Mark off a stripe or zone 5 m wide in the middle with cones. Two defenders are
                         positioned there.
                    ■■ Position additional players, depending on the desired stress level and skill level,
                         next to the goals with one ball each.
                    ■■ Keep a number of replacement balls on hand next to the goals.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The two players in possession signal each other, and each dribbles into the zone
                         for the 1v1.
                    ■■ The defender can only operate in the zone.
                    ■■ When the attacker loses possession, he switches to the zone and defends.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ The defenders immediately do a fast dribble to their new starting position or pass the
                         ball there with lots of speed and precision (changeover to offense) (passing tactics).


                                                                                                              277

                    ■■ After a turnover the attackers pursue (changeover to defense) (passing tactics).
                    ■■ Make sure both actions start simultaneously.
                    ■■ “Head up, no collisions in the zone!”
                    ■■ The pace in the zone must be situational:
                         1. Fake pass from a standing position because the space is usually very tight (see
                             M. Götze to A. Schürrle, World Cup qualifying game on Oct. 15, 2013, Sweden
                             vs. Germany 3-5).
                         2. Fake passes at a medium pace as the most common form in 1v1 (feint and at
                             least one alternative).
                         3. Complex feinting motions at top speed are not possible. Instead suggest body
                             feints and abrupt directional changes (goal: to overrun the opponent) (passing
                             intelligence and tactics).
                    ■■ “Get past the opponent and then a quick and incisive finish!” (Passing mindset)

                    Variations:
                    ■■ Organize competitions:
                         1. Passing fakes and feint-pro: Process with time period or number of goals to be
                             determined.
                         2. Team competitions (see 1) in which each goal scored with at least one fake
                             pass in the course of the overall action up to the finish counts as triple.
                         3. Biathlon-like competitions (emphasis passing fitness).
                    ■■ Use both feet and also frequently dribble from the left (passing technique).
                    ■■ If the goalie is able to hold on to the ball during the finish, he must throw the
                         ball quickly and incisively into additionally mini goals. This is a way for the
                         goalies to compete against each other (assistant or goalkeeping coach conducts
                         this competition and together with the goalie makes the rules) (goalie passing
                         technique and tactics; also see chapter 4.3.20).

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Two teams of three take turns playing 1v1 to the finish at one large goal with
                         goalie on a playing field that is 10 x 20 m. When the defenders win the ball,
                         a changeover game at three mini counterattacking goals ensues until a goal is
                         scored or conceded.
                    ■■ There is a minimum of seven players (including the goalie).
                    ■■ Keep a number of replacement balls on hand next to the goals.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player with the ball dribbles and plays a hard and incisive flat pass to the
                         player opposite him. He responds with a switch pass to the third teammate who
                         lets it rebound into the path of the switch pass player.
                    ■■ He dribbles toward the goal and is pressured by the first passing player.
                    ■■ In this 1v1 situation, the attacker uses passing fakes and feints until the finish.
                    ■■ Regularly switch sides on the field.

                    ■■ Attackers and defenders switch after a turnover. The rebounders also switch
                         regularly.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Scoring from the centerline is allowed.
                    ■■ Ask for fast and incisive flat passes (passing technique).
                    ■■ Receive and control the ball with a forward touch.
                    ■■ Use both feet.
                    ■■ Take into account the situation when choosing the pace (passing tactics and
                         intelligence).

                    Variations:
                    ■■ If the goals cause the deceptive motions and feints to not be used incisively and
                         situationally, players can dribble across lines or through goals.
                    ■■ Ask for pre-actions.
                    ■■ Add a rebounder as
                         a. an additional defender (e.g., possible double-teaming) or
                         b. an additional attacker (e.g., wall pass, Tiqui-Taca, or possible attack in a 2v1
                             situation) (passing technique and tactics).
                    ■■ Create 3v2 situations to create competitions in very tight spaces.
                    ■■ 3v3 at two large goals each with goalies (passing tactics and philosophy).

                    ■■ 1v2 until the finish on a 10-x-20-m playing field at one mini and two pole goals.
                    ■■ The goals are set up approximately 10 m from the two head ends.
                    ■■ There are at least four players (including one goalie).
                    ■■ Keep a number of replacement balls handy next to the goals.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ The player with the ball plays a wall pass with the outer teammate and directs the
                         rebounded ball with a one-touch pass out of the post-action to the player opposite
                         him.
                    ■■ He receives and controls the pass while moving and dribbles toward the goal.
                    ■■ The dribbling player and the wall pass players are pressured from the front and
                         the side.
                    ■■ In this 1v2 situation the attacker uses passing fakes and feints until the finish.

                    ■■ When the two defenders gain possession, changeover play at a large goal with
                         goalie ensues until a goal is scored or conceded.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Goals can be scored from the head ends.
                    ■■ Ask for quick and incisive flat passes (passing technique).
                    ■■ Receive and carry the ball with a forward touch.
                    ■■ Pay attention to the situation when choosing the pace (passing tactics and
                         intelligence).
                    ■■ “Both opponents are too slow in position: Quickly run past them or overrun them!
                         Don’t get outmaneuvered!” (Passing tactics)
                    ■■ “Both opposing players are positioned too far apart: Use passing fakes and feints

                    ■■ Easements for the single player:
                         a. Outnumbered player can take the shot at goal from the centerline.
                         b. Position passers between the goals and the head end (rebounders).
                    ■■ Ask for pre-actions.
                    ■■ Play with both feet.
                    ■■ Start competitions: Pass-faker of the day (with prizes or rewards).

                    Organization:
                    ■■ Four teams play 3v3 plus goalies at two large goals on adjacent fields that are
                         30 x 15 m.
                    ■■ Keep lots of replacement balls handy next to the goals.

                    Progression:
                    ■■ Players on the right field initially position in a triple axis with central defender,
                         midfielder, and forward. From these positions, the goalie initiates the following
                         action (see left playing field). The team in possession initiates mirror-inverted
                         fanning out.
                    ■■ Players on the left field are holding their lines, are already fanning out, and are
                         preparing for a pass from the goalie (offering support and getting open). The
                         goalie typically chooses the long pass (a) to the forward. He lets the ball rebound
                         to the right to the central defender after a previous fake pass to the left. This player
                         receives the pass at a high rate of speed and tries to affect a prompt finish.

                    Coaching:
                    ■■ Depending on axis position, position and ability of the opponent, positions
                         and ability of teammates (including goalie): sole inside turn, sole outside turn,
                         standing, carrying the ball to the side or back at a diagonal, rebounding, fake
                         passes, penetrating.
                    ■■ The goalies must execute additional game openers: (b) Pass to the midfielder
                         (second axis); (c) pass to the central defender.

                         defender on the outside, looks for cooperation from his partner and after the
                         pass lets the ball rebound to the second forward playing with the third man, who
                         finishes). Alternatives: Fake pass, sole outside turn in playing direction and 1v1.

                    This chapter focuses on the goalkeeper position as an active component at the game’s
                    opening and continued play from Marco Knoop’s point of view. The standard situation
                    of a penalty kick from the goalie’s perspective does not relate to the topics chosen by
                    us. We, therefore, refer the interested reader to the appropriate sources (Kibele 2013,
                    pg. 46-54; Neumaier/te Poel and Standtke 1987, pg. 23-32). The classification of
                    modern goalkeeping is based above all else on the findings of current sport science
                    research that objectively shows that the position-specific requirement profile for the
                    training of today’s goalkeepers has fundamentally changed15.


                         The language in this chapter has also been consciously chosen to incorporate
                         some goalkeeping-specific vocabulary into text and images. This is intended to add
                         greater authenticity for the practical and theoretical use with goalkeeper passing.


                    In the unabridged German version of this book, Marco Knoop introduces modern
                    goalkeeping drills starting with the U15 performance range. These drills should
                    be viewed as creative food for thought for coaches and instructors for diverse and
                    effective goalkeeper training on the field.

                    That the goalkeeper has a special function in a game is probably beyond dispute. He
                    is a special type of player who is not only dressed differently and gets to hold the ball
                    with his hands, but he also raises the tempers of spectators much more intensely and
                    longer with just a single error. On the other hand, a successful action is viewed as
                    rather normal. In this respect, goalkeeper training that focuses on further development
                    in the sense of the overall concept of this book (see chapter 4.3) should include the
                    areas of mindset and personality.


                    15    To the interested reader we additionally recommend the current published works of David Thiel (goalkeeper with Bayer
                          04 Leverkusen) (2012, pg. 7-19), DFB sports coach Jörg Daniel on set pieces (2013, pg. 34-41), Marten Arts of the

                       “A goalie is 75% of the game. Except if he is a bad goalie. Then it is 100%.”
                       (Gene Ubriaco quoted by Jochen Reimer in The Red Bulletin magazine, September, 2013 issue).



                    The quality of the defense’s final man can have a critical impact on the outcome of
                    the game. The goalie’s basic defensive actions, such as saving or deflecting flat balls
                    into the corner of the goal or in 1v1 situations, require a specialist. The extent of
                    the goalie’s soccer abilities, skills, techniques, and tactics is becoming increasingly
                    important and sometimes makes the difference between a mediocre and an excellent
                    keeper, particularly in today’s competitive soccer.

                    In the recent past, several scientific studies on the goalkeeper’s playing requirements
                    have been published. While the results are not entirely surprising to a soccer
                    expert, they do put the ratio of defensive to offensive actions of today’s goalies up
                    for discussion (see Ferrauti, Pischetsrieder, Knoop and Streibig 2009). At the 2008
                    Men’s European Championships, 20 top international goalkeepers demonstrated the
                    following goalkeeping behavior.

                    During a game the goalie, using the example of analyses from the 2008 Men’s
                    European Championships (see tab. 1), is confronted more often with offensive than
                    defensive actions overall.

                    Three principles for opening and continuing the game can be taken from these
                    descriptive analyses under the premise of continued possession and given to the coach
                    or instructor to bring to training:

                    can be seen in the following information, this new positional designation, also known
                    in soccer under the motto “the goalie as Libero,” requires more differentiated analysis

                    actions and stresses the three principles of modern soccer mentioned previously:

                    Tab. 2: The four main actions of a goalkeeper (as per Thaler and Krebs 2009)

                     Defensive actions (hand and foot) strictly to prevent a goal:                     9%
                     Playing actions (hand and foot) in and outside of the box:                        39%
                     Goal kicks/free kicks:                                                            31%
                     Continuing the game after receiving the ball:                                     21%

                    The study by Rechner and Memmert (pg. 32) published in 2010 expands on these
                    findings as it includes and analyzes players from the English Premiere League and
                    the Spanish Primera Division from 2008 and 2009. The study provides the following
                    results.

                    Tab. 3: Percentages of defensive and offensive goalkeeper actions during the evaluated games (as per
                    Rechner and Memmert 2010)

                     Goal defense (shots, headers, 1v1)                                               approx. 15%
                     Space defense (crosses/any kind of ball into the box and floaters)               approx. 10%
                     Foot play/opening the game (throw outs, punts, goal kicks, back approx. 75%
                     pass processing, and clearings)

                    In recent years, when tracking the empirical findings regarding the goalkeeper’s
                    modified requirements profile in today’s professional soccer, priorities and variances
                    with respect to method content within modern and sustainable goalkeeper training
                    (and thus the daily training processes) must change (see chapter 4.5). While the
                    authors classify all of the actions of modern goalkeeping as such, with the exception
                    of deflecting balls with hands, arms, and trunk, goalkeeper passing plays a central role
                    in everyday goalkeeper training.

                       “Whenever the Bayern or German national team is on the ball Manuel Neuer also
                       plays. He is good at initiating plays, quickly initiates counterattacks, and he is far
                       outside the goal when there is a high line in front of him. Over the years Manuel
                       has learned to recognize when the situation is right for him to come out of the goal.
                       He senses: Where must I stand? When can I come out? When can I come way out?
                       Of course he has made mistakes in the course of his career, but this style of playing
                       is important. In today’s soccer goalkeepers who can take on the part of Libero are
                       in demand. Manuel is always ready for a pass, which gives his team an advantage
                       in the back. He thereby meets the requirements for a modern goalkeeper perfectly
                       because the goalkeeper game has changed.”
                       (Joachim Löw, German national team coach, March 10, 2014, in kicker, pg. 6)



                    These necessary changes in the training of soccer goalkeepers also result in a change
                    in the goalie’s position within the team (passing philosophy, see chapter 4.1). What
                    does that really mean? If, for instance, a coach asks his team to play short passes
                    (see chapter 4.3.6) to accomplish a high possession rate, a goalkeeper, after having
                    received the back pass, usually has multiple short- and medium-distance passing
                    options because of the active demands of his teammates. He must adapt to and get
                    involved in these situations.

                    But if a coach brings a (playing) philosophy to the club that focuses on winning the
                    first or even second ball to surprise the disorganized opponent moving forward, the
                    goalie would be required to play a large number of incisive and long goalkeeper passes.
                    Training the passing game therefore closely correlates with the (playing) philosophy of
                    the coach or instructor and the team.

                    Today’s modern goalkeeper training is responsible for training goalkeepers in such a
                    way that they can appropriately participate in defensive and offensive team play.

                    Here, too, it becomes clear that isolated and largely technique-oriented goalkeeping
                    training is no longer enough for becoming an elementary part of the team with its key
                    performance factors, requirements, and playing philosophies (see chapters 1 and 3).

                  Passing DrILLs



                       Digression: As we have already determined, continued possession by the own team
                       after the game opener or continued play usually depends on the three principles:
                       Hand before foot, short before long, flat before high. Using the example of the
                       German national team goalie Manuel Neuer’s throw-out behavior we want to
                       explain why this technique can be of such great importance and plays such a
                       critical role for the team and the implementation of the playing philosophy in
                       the goalkeeper Passing Puzzle. When he quickly switched to offensive action after
                       intercepting a cross, his incisive long throw-outs—in some cases more than 65
                       yards—allowed him to speed up the entire team’s game by an extreme amount
                       and thereby put pressure (physical and mental) on the opposing team. Passing
                       the ball by hand can therefore be considered an actual pass because these passes
                       (rolling, hurling, punting) send the same message to the teammates as passes with
                       the foot: “I want to play with you! Here is a quality ball; do something with it!”
                       Moreover the pass by hand can be done much more accurately than by foot, and
                       the ball can’t be stolen as long as the goalie holds it in his hands. So the execution
                       can take place without time pressure, which clearly increases the success rate.


                    In view of that fact, during the selection of drills, training exercises were chosen that
                    include continuation of play with a pass by hand.

                    4.3.20.2 KEY POinTs aBOUT gOaLKEEPER Passing

                    The forms of training conceived by Marco Knoop primarily focus on short passes and
                    passes bridging medium distances within the goalie-specific passing game (referred
                    to as goalkeeper passing). To make the quality of the goalie-specific passing game
                    as effective as possible through training, we will at this point present a condensed
                    version of some goalie-specific elements for coaching and methods during training
                    units with goalkeepers (see tab. 4). Further methodological suggestions can be found
                    in chapter 4.5.

                     Use as few touches as possible, but as many as are necessary to keep up the pace.
                     Actively ask for the ball, signal availability to receive the ball (verbal: “Play!” and
                     “Open hand, where?”)
                     Create a comfortable distance to the opponent by offsetting width and depth.
                     Use precision and dosed hardness to create a time cushion for the open man to
                     process the pass.
                     First touch should be in playing direction so that the second touch can be well
                     prepared and no emergency solution (clearance) is required.
                     Avoid the ball coming to a dead stop.
                     Play simple passes (angle less than 90 degrees to the passer and receiver).
                     Form triangles to avoid passing across the supporting leg (loss of speed due to spin).
                     Thoughtless low-quality passes create pressure for the receiver (e.g., A clumsy pass to
                     the central defender). Remember: His problem will become your problem when the
                     central defender panics and plays an uncontrolled return pass.
                     Avoid balls with topspin as they are difficult to process because they are rough.
                     Balls to the central defender should always be played to the man and ideally to the
                     strong foot with instruction (“Cut!” or “Rebound!”).
                     Play balls to the 6er only when he is unchallenged, and then flat to the foot and
                     with instruction.
                     Balls to the wingback or the wide central defender should be played to the offensive
                     foot (foot in playing direction) and offer support if he does not cut outside.
                     Immediately after winning the ball or before a return pass scan the field for options.
                     First look goes deep, second one wide, third one short, and fourth strike if necessary
                     (safety first principle).
                     Be respectful in your actions (don’t humiliate the opponent and don’t play for time).



                       Do not cross that fine line from courage to rashness by overinterpreting the active
                       mindset. After all you wear the “1” and not the “10.” Preventing goals is the top
                       priority.

                    The coach can train and modify the following drills by using certain pressure regulators
                    with varying degrees of difficulty. This can also shift the presented training priority.
                    The following pressure factors can be useful in practical goalkeeper training.


                      PRESSURE OF TIME
                      Practical example: Counting down. When does the action have to be finished?

                      PRESSURE OF PRECISION
                      Practical example: Choose relatively small target goals or set them up far apart.

                      SITUATIONAL PRESSURE
                      Practical example: Use provocation rules or sanctions and bonuses.

                      PRESSURE OF COMPLEXITY
                      Practical examples: Create information overload through multitasking.

                      PRESSURE OF STRESS
                      Practical examples: Due to prior physical or mental fatigue.


                    The professional application of the depicted pressure regulators is based on the
                    Neumaier model (1999). It is referred to as the Coordination Requirements Regulator
                    Model and will not be elaborated on here (see Neumaier and Bush).

                    The coach’s point of view:


                       “It is absolutely necessary to find a clear-cut course and to make it perfectly
                       understood. Every player on the squad needs to understand the coach’s philosophy.
                       This requires definite agreements. And the coach must play by these rules and
                       enforce their adherence. Otherwise he will have a problem.”
                       (Jos Luhukay, head coach Hertha BSC, quoted in kicker, Sept. 9, 2013)



                    The player’s point of view:


                       “Most important is that the team has the right spirit. That everyone is willing to
                       go the extra mile for the other, defensively and offensively. When the mind and the
                       spirit and the passion are in it, that’s half the battle. The rest, the tactical, that just
                       fine-tunes everything and brings it closer to perfection.”

                    But what does a passing and playing philosophy actually look like, and how can it be
                    communicated to the players? To answer this question, we use the Hyballa/te Poel

                    1. Attack is the ticket with a narrow 1-4-3-3! Passing is the first choice because the
                         ball is faster than a dribbling player, and we have lots of triangles. Please note:
                         Before you get the ball you should already have a plan what to do with it! Avoid
                         square passes. (Passing line)
                    2. Pressing begins in the front. The forward signals for the pressing to start: “We want
                         to regain possession right away to continue to execute 1!” Therefore, win the ball
                         with “airbag” safety and then charge forward.
                    3. Opening the game, building up, and finishing: Tempo with the own attack. No
                         time-consuming cross-field play without gaining space, but rather putting pressure
                         on the opponent early with dribbling and long passes: passing relays and constant
                         position changes can wear the opponent down physically and mentally. Lightning
                         fast changes in speed and direction give the attackers direct scoring opportunities.
                         Central defenders should force the opposing forward out of their space with
                         targeted dribbling. Whoever dribbles or has to dribble because he doesn’t see
                         another option creates open space for his teammates that can be passed into. The
                         wingbacks should therefore not swing out to the sidelines because that only leaves
                         them options along the line. If they move farther in, they are able to operate inside,
                         forward, and outside. The pass to the center usually reaches the 6er in a half-
                         open position or with his back to the opposing goal. He, too, must immediately
                         attack, and if necessary open up into playing direction. The 10 position plays a
                         very important role here (e.g., in the previously mentioned 1-4-3-3 with point in
                         back). This player either dribbles toward the goal or tries to play through one of
                         the three forwards. The forwards also look for the short way to the goal with a 1v1.
                         The option of a wing attack always remains open. Crosses are mostly played flat
                         because flat balls are easier to process than waist-high or high balls.
                    4. Position training: Specify the grammar—in other words, dribbling, passing, opening
                         up, starting, and getting open for the attacking game. Positional discipline with
                         tactical problems for defensive play.

                       “Of course each position comes with a strategic task. Tactics are most important
                       in the area of defense because all parts must work together, and we have to be
                       able to rely on each other. The system has to function. Offensive play can be a little
                       loser. Here it is more about creativity, the element of surprise, the unexpected. A
                       rigid system would be a hindrance here.”

                    5. Set priorities within a form of play and coach situationally. Example:
                         Safe buildup:
                          ■■ Central defender dribbles into the next zone or flat passes to 6/8.
                          ■■ Skip the next zone with a pass (pass into space); no return passes into the
                                respective back zone.
                          ■■ Determine the number of mandatory stations per zone (holding on to the
                                ball).
                          ■■ Shot at goal for the finish from a specific zone (short pass or skip over).
                          ■■ team competitions: Team A against Team B with different guidelines for the
                                buildup.
                    6. The current game analyses play a large part in determining training content.
                    7. Use forms of play to enter into training. Offer interesting and motivational training,
                         particularly in youth training.

                    When combining the individual puzzles from chapters 4.3.1 to 4.3.20 and underpinning
                    them with those performance-determining factors in soccer that we consider essential
                    (see chapter 4.1), the question from the coach and instructor as well as the players
                    immediately arises: How do I put these important contents into practice during
                    training and instruction?

                    Entire libraries and digital compendiums are filled with answers to the question: How
                    do I impart and train my most important content with my players? The assumption
                    that trainability in today’s soccer of technique optimization (for modern passing game
                    training) is possible between the ages of 10 and 59 and the learning rate is steady is
                    an empirically-backed finding (see Wollny 2002).

                    The golden age of learning in youth training does not exist because training playing
                    techniques extends to the entire playing career (see Roth 2005b, pg. 339).

                    The target level for systematic technique training in soccer looks as follows (see Roth
                    2005b, pg. 336-337):


                      1. The phase of learning something new with attentive scrutiny.
                      2. The phase of overlearning with increasing scrutiny.
                      3. The phase of automation of individual technical sections accompanied by
                          attention to technical optimization.
                      4. The phase of stabilization and variability in the execution of techniques with
                          focus on solving open problems with the goal of gaining skills by result.


                    The method of levels in systematic technical training is based on the classification into
                    four target areas (Roth 2005b, pg. 338-339):


                      1. The phase of using simplification strategies (e.g., rhythm and orientation aids,
                          practicing in slow motion, minimal exertion)
                      2. A short phase of repeating techniques.
                      3. The phase of adding additional strategic challenges (see Szymanski 1997), with




                                                                                                        299

                          the goal of speeding up the automation processes by diverting attention (with
                          additional strategic tasks).
                      4. The phase of changing the basic patterns by directing freed up attention (e.g.,
                          with variable practice and random tasks and always combined with methods of
                          technical stabilization).


                    When looking at the goals and methods that allow the Hyballa & te Poel Passing
                    Puzzle IQ® training content to efficiently take effect over time (and divided into the
                    learning phases of a consortium) in the sense of allowing learning to efficiently take
                    effect, many open questions emerge:

                    ■■ With respect to technique training (keyword passing technique), these ranges
                         between the poles problem-oriented learning and theme-centered interaction
                         involve considerations from research on general and differential motor function
                         (keywords playing and practicing), and system-theoretical and action-oriented
                         argumentation (see Roth 2005b). A current study on training science by Voigt/
                         Hohmann and Singh (2013, pg. 4-15) on subjective training theories regarding the
                         competitive sports training process in game sports confirms the theory that more
                         research is required in which methods should primarily be used during levels of
                         technical training. In view of the fact that most coaches and instructors in game
                         sports focus primarily on the sport’s basic technical elements in, for instance, youth
                         sports, this represents on the one hand a central challenge and responsibility to
                         all parties concerned (see Voigt/Hohmann and Singh 2013, pg.7). “Thus the long-
                         term technical training strategy ranges between a permanent area of conflict
                         between the demand for perspectival, versatile training and developmental
                         training design, and on the other hand the timely creation of a highly developed
                         ability to compete based on specific motor programs” (see Voigt/Hohmann and
                         Singh 2013, pg.7). Furthermore recent technical innovations are becoming more
                         popular with professional clubs, youth soccer centers, and camps. Two examples
                         of this are the Footbonaut (training center for technical training at BV Borussia
                         Dortmund 09) and Quick Feet (individual passing and receiving training system

                         received a sport-scientific evaluation at this time.


                       “Correcting mistakes is the most important technological and learning method
                       overall. It appears to be the only method for progress in biological evolution. The
                       terms method, trial and error are justified, but in doing so one underestimates the
                       importance of a wrong conclusion or mistake – of the flawed attempt […] All of
                       life is solving problems.”
                       (Popper 1995, pg. 256-257)



                    ■■ There is still much research needed in the area of tactical skills training (keyword
                         passing tactics) with respect to the efficiency of training methods for performance
                         (see Roth 2005c), and the inconsistent points of view among game sports
                         coaches on combining game-situational training of individual players—keyword
                         individualization (example 2013 BDFL [Association of German Soccer Instructors]
                         conference)—with a team’s collective tactical style of play (see Voigt/Hohmann &
                         Singh 2013, pg. 13).
                    ■■ In the area of game sports conveyance there is the question of the optimal
                         relationship between implicit and explicit appropriation processes, which also
                         applies to the ambiguous statements regarding the frequently applied policies
                         “playing and practicing” and “playing before practicing” (see Roth 2005a):


                       “There is a lack of entities for the continued development of players. We still talk
                       about training teams. But training must include practice, not just application.”
                       (Marcus Sorg, coach U19 German national team, at the introduction of the UEFA Youth League in the Frankfurter

                       Allgemeine Zeitung, Sept. 17, 2013, pg. 29)



                    ■■ However in practical training and instruction technique training cannot be
                         planned and executed without assessing the correlation between fitness training

                          of the development of individual form presents a prospect for continuing research
                          in the future. There are still many open questions in this area.
                    ■■ Complex training, a magic word for every modern type of training and instruction?
                          The complex training approach links coordinative, technical, tactical, and mental
                          factors (keyword passing intelligence). It is very competition-like, is geared toward
                          improving performance factors in game-like contexts, is intended to effect
                          temporization, and increases motivation (see Memmert 2005, pg. 360). To what
                          extent mental and physical strain during actual competitions can be replicated in
                          competition-oriented training is still unclear and debated.
                    ■■ Is the accent method provided by the block-by-block training of performance
                          factors an effective means for learning-based (vs. intentional) training processes
                          (see Frey & Hildenbrandt 1995, pg. 110)?
                    ■■ When adding the coaching factor (see Seeger 2008; Bechthold 2014, pg. 22-26;
                          Merz & Thiel 2014, pg. 39-45) whose goal it is to “achieve the highest-possible
                          degree of competition and action readiness via optimal focus and motivation
                          during competitive play” (Seeger 2008, pg. 9)? We have come full circle back to
                          chapters 2,3, and 4:


                         For the chosen topics we provide a somewhat simplistic link between the passing
                         mindset and the target areas communication and interaction (“Learning to
                         understand each other!”), action, motivation, self-confidence, attitude, and the
                         players’ emotional state as key aspects within a pass16. Self-efficacy and collective
                         action are not mutually exclusive.


                    Since many coaches and instructors consider the importance of disciplined play, stress
                    stability, and the necessity of one or possible multiple leaders in U17 to U21 teams
                    to be crucial to successful competitive play, coaching with unimpeded communication
                    plays a central role (see Voigt/Hohmann & Singh 20113, pg. 13; Bechthold & Otto


                    16    At this point in the learning process some special consideration must be given to the standards and parts of the
                          goalkeeper’s game because their effectiveness is primarily subject to the development of stable motor problem-solving
                          methods or variable coping patterns for closed and slightly open tasks (see chapter 4.3.20).

                                                       THE Passing gaME is a PREREQUisiTE FOR gOOD sOCCER




                    2014, pg. 22-27). How can this be implemented in the field? Next to motivational
                    measures during practice and games such as praise, incentive, encouragement, volition
                    training, and stamina, that are often forgotten in professional soccer, the following
                    two examples from our own training and competition practice can help positional
                    groups orient themselves appropriately on the field using previously agreed upon fixed
                    code words:

                    1. Example for situational coaching among players:

                      ■■ “No opponent at the back? Open up!”
                      ■■ “Opponent at the back? One-touch pass!”
                      ■■ “Behind the opponent? Pre-action: Get out of the cover shadow!”
                      ■■ “Pass into space? Post-action: Go with the ball!”
                      ■■ “Tight space, opponent presses? Tiqui-Taca, give-and-go passes and rebounds,
                           or triangle passes!”
                      ■■ “Get out of a tight space? Deep and wide switch passes!”


                    The previously mentioned agreements are implemented vocally, through gestures, eye
                    contact, body language, and behavioral responses, and their appropriateness must be
                    pondered continuously.

                    2. Example for helping each other during practice and competition by determining
                       specific codes.

                      Codes for field players:
                      “Open!” or “Time!” (You are able to dribble, shoot, or pass without interference from
                      the opponent!)
                      “Man!” (Watch out, the opponent is already close to you!)
                      “Coming!” (Watch out, opponent is approaching!)
                      “Run!” or “Pressure!” (Go to the ball, I’ve got your back!)
                      “Pass forward!” or “Through!” (Play a long ball!)
                      “Open up!” (Quickly turn in playing direction!)
                      “Chip!” (Play a short but well-directed fly ball with spin)!



                                                                                                        303

        German Soccer
                  Passing DrILLs



                      “Dribble!” (Dribble when you can’t pass or shoot!)
                      “Fire!” (Pick up the pace!)
                      “Tiqui-Taca!” (Hold on to the ball, slow it down!)
                      “Bounce! and Turn!” (Play the ball right back to me, turn quickly, and get open!)
                      “Move up!” (Quickly close up to the front line!)
                      “Switch!” (Swiftly play the ball to other side of the field by switching sides!)
                      “Let it go!” (You can let the ball go past your supporting leg, no opponent near
                      you!)
                      “Close the middle!” (Players on the off-ball side must move toward the center!)
                      “Help!” (Offer support so the player in possession can pass easily!)

                      Code words for goalkeepers:
                      “Leo!” (Shout from the goalie when he feels his players need to let the ball go.)
                      “Here!” (Shout from the goalie when the ball must be played back because he is
                      not coming out of the goal.)
                      “Go to!” (Shout from the goalie when he does not come out of the goal with a high
                      ball but rather wants the players to engage in an air duel; possibly combined with
                      a name.)


                    ■■ A detailed description of the passing philosophy was already provided in chapter
                         4.4 via the “own plan.” Before it is implemented in the field with the aid of team
                         psychological methods and techniques for practical use (see Baumann 2008), this
                         plan should be introduced to the team, the support staff, the BOD/supervisory
                         committee, established fan groups, the press, and the sponsors. If the plan and
                         its objectives are understood and even accepted it clearly adds to its improved
                         functional cohesion, contentment, and social cohesion (Baumann 2008, pg. 62).
                         Because with the implementation of the present Hyballa/te Poel Passing Puzzle
                         IQ® all participants also or particularly want diversion and to experience something
                         special, without having to abandon the tried and true. But that requires mutual
                         trust and multiple heads.

                       Success cannot be planned, but performance can with a coach or instructor and
                       one’s own environment!


                    Because of limited publication a more detailed description of the team psychological
                    rules and techniques for effective implementation of the passing philosophy cannot
                    be included here.

                    In our attempt to structure and systemize, the beginner training will be excluded
                    from our modern passing game and will be presented elsewhere from the point of
                    view of a school that teaches ball games. This also applies to the areas of mental
                    coaching, leadership styles, and the substantial debate started by the German Dr. Phil.
                    (kinesiology) W.I. Schöllhorn on the customary system of principles in training and the
                    presentation of an alternative approach that includes standards from science theory
                    (see Schöllborn, Beckmann and Michelbrink 2013, pg. 5-10).

                    The notion that particularly technical and tactical content should be combined in the
                    learning process in game sports and combat sports (see Szymanski 1997; Roth 2005a,
                    b, and c; Wormuth 2011 and 2013) is currently beyond dispute in game sport research
                    and top-level soccer. On the other hand, based

                    on findings from the psychology of action and teaching psychology Wahl (2012, pg. 55)
                    points out that learning through playing “[…] should be supplemented by selectively
                    interspersed phases of explicit learning” so the learners are able to “organize” their
                    actions.

                    This does not only help to better read a game but also to anticipate externally and
                    internally, to make better decisions under time pressure, and to monitor the execution
                    of movements more consciously. The former DFB head instructor Erich Rutemöller
                    already transferred this approach to fitness training in soccer in 2010 (pg. 40), and
                    the coaching instructor and athletic director of the DFB youth program Jörg Daniel
                    currently continues this approach via basic games for learning techniques that preserve
                    complexity and motivation, but also facilitate the grinding in of the movements.

                    ■■ fun (Rutemöller, pg. 52-53).

                    But the established deficiencies in research and the associated open questions
                    regarding the overall effectiveness of many methodical suggestions on the topic will
                    not prevent the authors from giving a nuanced presentation of methods and rules of
                    teaching training for the modern passing game and to categorize according to their
                    priorities and their affinity for the training and teaching goal: motor, cognitive, and
                    mixed (linked). They refer to the individual puzzle pieces and their correlation with the
                    selected performance factors technique, tactics (including passing intelligence), and
                    fitness (stamina).

                    Unsorted and fragmented descriptions of teaching methods and rules along with
                    bibliographical references for continuing self-guided studies (see tab. 5) can be found
                    in the following chart.

                    Using the same metaphor as in chapters 2, 3, and 4, coaches and instructors should
                    critically contemplate this framework with respect to the specific requirements of
                    their team or group, correlate it with the coaching elements and the variations in
                    chapters 4.3.1-4.2.20, and create customized learning processes based on their own
                    experiences.


                       “Roughly 55% of all goals are not random. Thus the greater part of a team’s
                       fortune still rests in its own feet.”
                       (Memmert, Strauss & Theweleit 2013, pg. 97)

                          One-dimension games:
                          Basis modular games can teach individual basic techniques from many game
                          sports via numerous similar recurring situational constellations.

                          Diversification:
                          Using different motor skills in basis modular games can help to form original
                          variations to solutions.

                          Deliberate coaching:
                          No instructions should be used in the basis modular games that diminish the
                          attention and focus of the participants.

                          Deliberate play:
                          Acting without directions in the basis modular games can result in trying out
                          different kinds of solutions.

                          Deliberate motivation:
                          Hope-based instructions that generate more unusual solutions should be used
                          in the basis modular games.

                    The key to a modern passing game fits into the lock and can be used any time in
                    many different ways. It is intended to help a player and all others involved to sort
                    and to optimize different thoughts and approaches to end up with an improved
                    scope of experience. This takes extensive and intensive work overall (game!) as well
                    as the details, much time, patience, persistence, and understanding for the different
                    behaviors of people in the process, conceptual work, and lots of faith from everyone in
                    its success. And finally, a word of wisdom from the previously mentioned Heidelberg

                       What drives us? The around-the-clock search for the ultimate (passing game)
                       training and game, true professionalism with a strong leaning towards self-

                    The entire soccer world is talking about Barcelona’s wonderful Tiqui-Taca, FC Bayern
                    Munich’s attractive and very successful flat and combination pass game during the
                    2012/2013 season, the extremely successful continuation of Munich’s collective but
                    varied and successful soccer under Pep Guardiola during the 2013/2014 season
                    (German national champions, DFB Cup champions, and world champions), and
                    Borussia Dortmund’s surprising killer pass game under the German soccer instructor
                    Jürgen Klopp. One usually associates this with a passing game as a requirement for

                    Even a “soccer god” like Pelé is already asking the protagonists of the current soccer
                    Bundesliga and the national team in commercials to preserve the exclusive right (of
                    Brazilian soccer) to a light-footed and technically sophisticated and delightful soccer
                    game.

                    Respect and esteem must be earned. Everything has its price, even from a temporal,
                    textual, and methodical point of view. It is therefore important, particularly in
                    professional training, to continuously scrutinize basic and key performance factors.
                    What is behind this magical passing game of present day outstanding teams and
                    national teams with respect to content and methods, and how can that really be
                    trained, practiced, and taught on the training ground? We have attempted to answer
                    this question with many of their own playing variations and drills, but not all passes
                    are created equal, and quality does not fall into someone’s lap!

                    Based on this fundamental assumption and taking into account theoretical game
                    considerations and situational game findings, we developed our own teaching
                    approach known as the Hyballa/te Poel Passing Puzzle IQ®. It is intended as a custom
                    review of the very diverse and often neglected passing game, to be used for training
                    at all playing levels, and to be effectively used in its many different variants on the
                    training ground.

                    Furthermore, in a second German book about the passing game that has been
                    published in 2015, the authors will present for the training of coaches and instructors
                    on the field

                    ■■ numerous best practice examples with interviews on the passing game from an
                         international perspective,
                    ■■ an attractive and practice-oriented model of a school that teaches ball games to
                         young children,
                    ■■ an insight into the workings of a world-class technique shop,
                    ■■ detailed practice forms for passing schools of top trainers and clubs, and
                    ■■ the point of view of the well-known sport scientist (with special expertise in soccer)
                         of Dr. D. Memmert (German Sports College Cologne).

                    The selection of topics will be presented to the interested public at large in an
                    appropriate and non-ideological manner and without claiming completeness, by
                    means of explanation, illustration, and interpretation of the our own teaching model,
                    the Hyballa/te Poel Passing Puzzle IQ®. May each interested reader draw his or her
                    own conclusions.

                    In the future, we are considering a more intensive practical implementation of our own
                    teaching model and the continuation of the chosen methodical and textual approach
                    to other key performance factors in soccer.

                    Furthermore we discuss issues that will be more closely examined in the future:

                    ■■ What does the passing game of the future look like? Does it have even more speed;
                         can neural networks be the answer to this question?
                    ■■ Highly intensive interval training (HIT) and passing training? How can both areas
                         be reconciled in terms of learning and training or rather structuring stress and
                         strain during the training process?
                    ■■ The pros and cons of 11-0 passing play?
                    ■■ Long-term work in the sense of training to become a pro soccer player (via soccer
                         instructors and coaches) with the Hyballa/te Poel Passing Puzzle IQ®. Who is
                         interested in a long-term field test?
                    ■■ The role of the coach and instructor in today’s modern passing game? Observer,
                         admonisher, guide, and with what effective methodical inventory?
                    In closing, we would like to cite quotations from three different sources on these
                    complex topics that could not have been said any better:


                       kicker: What is important in soccer?

                       Lucien Favre (Head coach Borussia Mönchengladbach): “The problem is obvious:
                       Space is tight, and solutions must be found to be able to go deep. This requires
                       patience and precision. And intelligence. Playing intelligence is important; the
                       game must be read and anticipated. Otherwise it gets difficult. It takes the right

                       balance between technique, athleticism, and running ability. And the mindset
                       must be right.

                       kicker: You always talk about precision.

                       Lucien Favre (Head coach Borussia Mönchengladbach): Yes, take the passing
                       game for example. The quality of passes is important to me. How can I play quickly
                       when the balls are sloppy? That doesn’t work! The pass has to be accurate and
                       played clean and at the right moment.”
                       (Lucien Favre in a kicker interview with H. Hasselbruch and J. Lustig, 2011, “Netzer is Right” 22, pg. 10-13)



                       “Only when one first gets completely wrapped up in the details like a wild man
                       is one sometimes rewarded with moments of complete lightness. It is similar to a
                       great violinist. Whenever he plays the violin so easily and everyone feels like they
                       might be able to fly. He actually worked his fingers to the bone on that.”
                       (Christian Streich, head coach of Bundesliga and European League team FC Freiburg, quoted in Memmert et

                       al. 2013, pg. 215)



                       “Creation is never complete. It did start once. But it will never end.”
                       (Immanuel Kant)


                    And that’s the end of it.
