   More Small-Sided Games
   to Help Train your Team




One of the most important components of a training session is the ‘small-sided game’.
Whether it’s a local youth team, college team or a top professional team, they all use
small-sided games to help their players make the transition from drills and exercises to
real game situations. It’s this transition that translates skills and techniques from practice
into your game on the weekend.

Coaching Soccer through Small-Sided Games contains 101 games that incorporate a
wide range of topics including: Passing and Possession, Shooting, Crossing and Finishing,
Defending, Half Field Games and Full Field Games. Small-sided games are a great way to
focus on these topics in a game-like situation. Another benefit of incorporating small-
sided games into your training sessions is that players enjoy them.

Four Team Warm-Up
Field size – 50 yards long, and the width of the penalty area. Use a goal
at each end with a goalkeeper in each. The session is based on having 16
to 18 field players and two goalkeepers, but can be modified to just about
any number of players.

Organize your field players into groups of four (with different colored
bibs) with one ball between each group. They begin by passing the ball
with short passes. When either goalkeeper calls your team color, the
player on the ball strikes the ball easily into the goalkeepers arms. The
keeper then throws the ball out to another in the same group and the
passing continues.

Stop every few minutes to stretch dynamically, making sure all muscle
groups are stretched.
                                                                                                         worldclasscoaching.com



Continue and move to longer passes, followed by driven strikes, with
more power, but still into the goalkeepers arms.




Team Hand Ball to Goal
The players move the ball by passing it with their hands. They aren’t
allowed to move with the ball in their hands. A goal is scored by

Hand Ball Warm-Up (10 Minutes)
The players jog and stretch for the first five minutes. The players then
progress to playing a possession game using only their hands. Ten
passes equal a goal. The players are not allowed to move with the ball
in their hands. Players must move off the ball to create passing options.
The players are only allowed to hold the ball for three seconds.

Warm-Up Passing and Moving Game
Each team has four players. The Dark Team players each have a ball. They
try to pass the ball to the Yellow Team players who pass it back one-
touch. The Red Team must mark the White Team.                                 s

Keepaway Game
This time when the coach shouts the player’s number they sprint into the
other teams square and play 4 v 1 (in this case) until the defender wins
the ball.

Whichever of the two numbered players win the ball first get a point for
their team.

the ball if your opponent has it. Repeat for each player, 4 repetitions
each player.

In the same 10 metre squares, 2 v 2, again with 4 players on the
outside providing balls, this time the work is for 2 minutes, with 4
repetitions for each player.

Finally in 30 metre squares, 4 v 4 , this time with balls all around
the pitch, 4 minutes work, repeated 4 times ( this game is man/
man marking). This is very high intensity training, and requires total
concentration and focus.

2 v 2 + Targets
The dark team has one minute to play against the white team. The
team in possession try to work the ball from one red target player to
the other. If the dark team plays the ball to one target player then
they cannot play back to that player, they must try and get the ball
through to the other target player. If the yellow team wins the ball
they keep the ball and try to move it from one target to the other.

After one minute, one player from each team trades places with
a target player. The game focuses on the turning and dribbling
techniques used in the previous conditioning practice. This game is
played with a high level of intensity so each game must only last a
short time, usually one minute.

5 v 5 +2
Two teams of three play on a 14 x 25-yard field with a neutral player on
each end. A goal is scored by moving the ball from one neutral player to
the other. (Not shown)

two supporting players on the end of the field that they are attacking.
The players look to pass to one of the supporting players to score. If a
team intercepts the ball in the opponents half of the field, then they can
shoot on goal and score. The emphasis is on immediate pressure when
possession is lost. The outside players have only one touch.
                                                                                                            30 Yards

defenders win the ball or the ball comes out of the small square then all
of the dark team become active and they play 7 v 5 using all of the area
within the larger square. If the white team wins the ball back or it goes
out of the larger square then the drill begins again with the white team
in possession within the 10 x 10-yard inner square.

Multiple Goal Possession Game
The game is played on the whole pitch with eight cone gates spread
around the field. The objective is to maintain possession while scoring
points by passing the ball through the cone gates but they only get the
point if the pass is received by a teammate on the other side of the gate.
They are not allowed to score in the same gate directly after a point is
scored, they must look for a different gate to score.

Progression
Play with a one or two-touch restriction.

                                                                                   Shooting


Shooting and Finishing Games
The group is divided into two teams of six. One team works as
attackers and one as the defenders.

The first player in line attacks the defender 1 v 1 in Area 1. When
that matchup is finished. The attacker moves to Area 2 and plays
2 v 1 to goal. In the final stage both attacking players from Area 2
move to Area 3 and play 4 v 2 to score.

The teams change roles once all of the players have had a chance
to move through all of the stations.

This is not a small-sided game strictly speaking but a creative
combination of games so we included it here.                                                         worldclasscoaching.com




Shooting vs Possession
Two teams of eight compete but each team has different
objectives. The dark team plays possession and is able to use their
teammates that are positioned on the side lines of the area. The
white team attempts to score on either goal while using their
teammates who are positioned on each end line.

The two teams change objectives and positions after four minutes.

Coaching Points
• The white players must work hard to get the ball away from the
  dark team
• Move into shooting positions quickly once the ball is won
• The dark team keeps the ball as long as possible                                                   worldclasscoaching.com




Switching Play to Score Small-Sided Game
The object of the game is to pass the ball into one of the two flank
areas and score from a cross. One player from the midfield zone can
move into the attacking third and attempt to score. When the play
breaks down the ball can be played directly into the midfield zone to
create a 2 v 1 situation as the midfielder is recovering to help defend.

Coaching Points
• Speed of play and thought
• Control
• Timing of all runs

 9 v 9 Offside Shooting
 I devised this practice to solve the problems I had with players having a tendency to run too early and thus into an offside position to receive a pass, plus to
 teach players to pass the ball into space rather than to the player.

 The practice is 9 v 9 in the middle third of a full field that is marked into thirds with lines also extending from the penalty area as shown in diagram 13.
 Two coaches are positioned on the lines to see if a player runs into an offside position. The game starts with a coach serving the ball to the dark team who
 has to make a minimum of three passes before they can pass over the line and into space for a teammate who then goes 1 v 1 against the goalkeeper.
 Following an attempt at goal, the coach serves a ball to the white team and the game continues.

 • The following are the tendencies of the players that this practice will help
   overcome.                                                                                                      A1

 • Attempting the final pass even when the opportunity is not there

 • Play tends to be squeezed in a tight area instead of using the full width of
   the field
 • The final pass is played to the player instead of to space
 • The running player (A1) will run too early - offside
 • The running player (A1) will run to the wrong area

6 v 6 + Goalkeepers
Similar setup as previous exercises but now with goals placed at each end
of grid. Players set up with a 2-2-2 formation. A shot on goal results on
the team getting the ball back and attacking the other goal.
                                                                                                            s

4v4
Two teams of four plus goalkeepers play in an area twice the size of the
penalty box. A third team of four players waits outside the area.

The play always starts with one goalkeeper throwing to the other who
then plays the ball to his teammates.

The team that scores stays on and plays the team that was off.

Defensive Coaching Points
• Early pressure on the ball            • Balance
• Cover around the first defender       • Commitment - Desire to win the
                                                                                                      worldclasscoaching.com
  and the ball                            ball - Desire to defend your goal




Progression #1
The third team now become crossers, one in each corner grid. The
attacking team must make four passes before playing the ball to a
crossing player. One of the passes MUST be to the goalkeeper.
Defensive Coaching Points
• Pick up a man and get goal side       • Defend the goal - priority!
• Body shape one - see man & ball       • Be ready for second ball
• First to the ball - attack the ball   • Clear your box
Keeper’s Coaching Points
• Starting position - related to ball   • Decision: talk and take control
• Positive body language                • Angle of approach and timing
• Judge the flight of the cross                                                                       worldclasscoaching.com




Progression #2
The crossing players now cut the ball back away from the endline, and
serve an in-swinging cross with the other foot. The weak side crosser can
leave his box and attack the cross.

When the goalkeeper comes to win the ball the defenders should cover
around the back of the keeper assuming he will make a mistake.

   C                                                          A conditioning element can be introduced by asking A1, A2, A3 and
                                                              A4 to make recovery runs back into the middle third playing area as

                                                              back into play as soon as the players have made their attempt on goal.

Flank Handball
Players play regular handball. However, the ball must be served (thrown)
to a running target in the arc from a player in the open flank channel.
In order for the goal to count, three other players must get to the three




                                                                                      s
                                                                               40 Yard
cones outside just outside of the arc. This encourages getting numbers
into the box, spacing and/or “framing” of the goal box.

Variation
Players on cones can flick/tip ball to player in arc if the serve is off.
                                                                                             40 Yards

Three Zone To Goal
Teams play 8 v 8 + GK (3-4-1 formations). A 25-yard wide central zone is
sectioned off (pinnies tend to be better markers on the field than cones).
Players are restricted to two-touch in center zone and unlimited touches
otherwise. This encourages “East/West” soccer and gets the ball wide.

Coaching Points
• Central players must position/prepare body early to get early balls out
  to flanks
• Passes to flank players must be out in front (in stride) of player
• Encourage overlapping and interchanging of WMF and outside backs.
  Runs forward must be timed and width must be established by flank
  players as ball is switched
• The Center Midfielder must get into box and join strikers                                                   worldclasscoaching.com




“Magic Box”
8 v 8 + GK (3-4-1) is once again played. Now a 25 x 15-yard coned box is
placed on the middle of the field. Players can not pass or dribble forward
through the box. This encourages more switching of the ball and also
pulls central players wider for angled passes towards outside channels
(which will force flank players out to the touch line.)

Coaching Point
Discourage long build-ups and encourage early balls wide and quick
switches, especially to final 1/3.

                                                          Flank Zones
                                                          The field is now smaller to provide more repetitions and put the teams
                                                          in their attacking third at all time. Each team has attacking players in
                                                          wide channels. The ball is played to the flank player in the channel who
                                                          prepares and serves it into the box.

                                                          • Allow overlapping player into channel (if flank players 1st touch is onto
                                                            playing field)




                                                          11 v 11 with the Flanks Free
                                                          Two teams of 11 on a marked out pitch with the flank areas free. The
                                                          teams adopt a specific playing formation (4-4-2 / 4-3-3 / etc.)

                                                            onto the ball there; they are allowed a maximum of three touches and
                                                            then they come back into play again (control, pass, cross)
